{"pages": [{"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/mykeyboardbaby1.html", "content": "I have always been intrigued but cautious about making a chestnut keyboard [as on Manuel's original], since the harder keys could conceivably be clattery and noisy. Well, I made a dummy chestnut key out of the one big plank of the wood I've been hoarding for years, and it is quiet and smooth as silk. Chestnut, even though it looks pretty much like oak or sassafras wood, is actually quite surprisingly light and easy to work. I found references to chestnut being tractable and easy to work puzzling until I actually cut into this stuff.  But something even more interesting. The replacement dummy chestnut key, with a tangent installed, yielded a note almost twice as loud and rich in fundamental as the original basswood lever. All of this somehow related to the very fruitful discussion G***** D***** elicited regarding the role of mass in keylevers in discouraging the absorption of energy as heat by the keylever, and pushing it instead to the soundboard. Pretty damned cool....Theresome kinks to work out on the design. The scaling, as we discussed once before, is anomalous and puzzling. Was Manuel an idiot, or was there a practice we need to learn about? The scaling is quite short, really, up to well above middle c. But by c\" the scaling is approaching about right or even a bit risky (on a clavichord; it would be fine on a harpsichord) for brass at A415, and at c\" the scaling is the equivalent of a c\" of 12.6\", which is way off the charts for brass at a pitch even remotely conceivable for the rest of the clavichord. The two I built from this layout in the late '70s/early '80s, I learn from the drawings I just found, incorporated a rationalized scale, which, in itself, is fine. But another possibility is that there was a crossover to iron somewhere, say between c' and c\". But the top half would still be short-ish for iron.  The top-half stringing on the original is missing (!) I'm going to test some Voss iron on the monochord, and try an iron string or two on my big [unfretted] instrument at the length/pitch/gauge that would occur on the new instrument just to see what I find. Either we'll be at around 440, with a crossover to iron somewhere around c\", or we'll rationalize the scale and string all in brass at around 415. And in passing, there are quite a few iron remnants on some of the other Lisbon clavichords, which Doderer ascribes to the muddle-headed meddling of 19th-century piano-tech repairers/\"restorers,\" but one wonders.... one simply cannot avoid the realities of Manuel's scaling. The really huge and odd #13 [in Doderer's list], expanded in 1855 or so (!), has a similar, though less dramatic, stretch in the treble with shortness in the mid-range. Several others show some extant evidence of brass up to about the middle with a crossover there into rather heavy iron. This pattern is the one thing which can be made to work convincingly with Manuel's set up. I have decided that for once one should take one's own advice and not try to outsmart the evidence. So my plan is to keep Manuel's scaling, string in brass to a little above middle c, and string, ahem, assertively. I've been using the big unfretted here [built several years ago] as a guinea pig. The other day I put .35mm (.014\", which is huge) Voss iron on the choir whose length is the same as the c\" on Manuel's instrument. WOW. Big, fat, strong sound.  And that incredibly long 160mm c''', which raised the red flag in the first place, strung in .30mm iron just zings all over the place. And remember that with a pairwise-fretted instrument the net tensions will be not much greater than half of those on my own big [unfretted] clavichord. Now, by middle c the scaling gets quite short, and it's time for beefy brass. But at that point I started making comparisons with the relationship between pitch and length on [a smaller fretted clavichord], whose pitch I placed a tone lower than I normally might have done, and which works wonderfully well, and Manuel's lengths at 440 here are almost exactly the same (for the same absolute pitch) as on [the smaller clavichord] at 466.I'll try to get a picture of those beautiful little trenails tomorrow. Also, the outer edge bottom moldings went on very nicely. Overall look of the thing really is Stickley-esque, what with the quarter-sawn oak. Oh: fuming. You put it into some kind of tent with a dog dish full of ammonia.ammonia, which is \"aqua ammonia,\" which is 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (household NHOH is 3%). Stuff will really wake you up in the morning. If you open the jug and hold your hand above the open neck, you can get blisters. Chemical reaction, not a stain, so there's no change in the texture or clarity of the wood.The two little blocks against the spine went on today - and are actually three blocks, but you can't see the one further up by the bellyrail. All these are things for me to rest the backrail on (on which the key ends will rest) when I glue it down (next thing to make and glue in, making sure that its height above the bottom is consistent and correct).  They won't be visible once the backrail goes on.  Wrestplank is oak, from a humongous chunk we drove to Portland for, since I didn'twant to glue one up from smaller pieces. Liners are generic conifer, which is something I use a lot (in this case, of all things, some nice larch). The belly rail is tulip poplar because I had a conifer belly rail split on me once, and tulipifera doesn't do that. The liner that is inside the cheek overlaps the belly rail a tad. This spot is one where the soundboard can walk leftwards like a treble harpsichord soundboard, except for the part trapped in the cheek corner, and split with a shear crack.  If the belly rail can lean or wobble leftwards this is exacerbated greatly, so the overlap cantilevers the support back behind the cheek and makes it very rigid.The backrail will be 20mm wider and parallel to the taper of the rack/hitchpin rail, which will sit down on top of it.  A nice subtlety of the do Carmo design: the bass/left hitchpin rail is cutout (looking down) in a kind of slightly dovetail-like shape for 11 mm from the front face in the back left corner.  The spine hitchpin rail/rack drops into this dovetail and this helps strengthen it against being pulled out of the instrument and flung into the faces of the audience."}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/notuncnj.html", "content": ""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/diss.html", "content": ""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/evil/evil.html", "content": ""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/pangan/index.html", "content": ""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/santanyi_registration.html", "content": "Every registration given here, no matter how obvious, can actually be found in historical sources, unless otherwise indicated by the use of a qualifier such as \"presumably\" or \"probably.\"(1) The Baroque period was one of a great deal of experimentation. A few experimental instruments turned out to have brilliant futures (the unfretted clavichord, the piano), but most did not, even though some were moderately successful at the time (the, the Pantaleon [a kind of keyed dulcimer], clavichords with wooden or half-leather-covered tangents, etc., etc., etc.) Pianos were around for a good fifty years before they become instruments of major importance. The point is that the mere appearance of some feature does not mean that that feature was widespread. For example, there are sporadic appearances on Spanish organs of devices to change the registration with the feet or knees, but these did not become common until at least the mid-18th century (and garnered criticism even then).(2) Nearly all Baroque organ music has vanished. The great art of the Baroque organist was improvisation. This was what they trained for, this was what they were tested on, and this is what they played. The vast bulk of the surviving Spanish organ repertoire consists of written-down improvisations. When music was published, the preface often gives us a reason for publication. Cabez\u00f3n's works were published by his son in order to increase his father's reknown. Correa's works were published for the benefit of student organists. Some music was written down explicitly as lessons, for example Scarlatti's and Seixas's sonatas. But most music is preserved in mansuscripts, and not in the composers' hands, and we simply don't know who wrote it down or why (all of the works of Coelho and Cabanilles, for example). Were these study pieces? Were they played in public and, if so, only by second-raters (players who performed previously composed music were derided as \"paper organists\")? In any event, what we consider to be \"Spanish Baroque Organ Music\" represents only a very small part of the organ culture of the time.(3) Historical registrations are only suggestions. We are not historical people playing for historical audiences under historical conditions. For example, my home organ setup has modern keyboards which make historical fingerings and therefore historical phrasings somewhat of a problem. Furthermore, much of the historical repertoire was played, or at least studied, over a long period of time: many pieces were copied over a period of a hundred years or more. This conservatism was characteristic of the Iberian pennisula.  But the organs themselves changed noticeably through time, as outlined below. If, say, Cabanilles's works were played on the Santany\u00ed organ (and we don't know that they were, but it's quite possible), they would not have been registered as Cabanilles would have registered them: the Santany\u00ed organ is very different from the organs that Cabanilles knew, and there's not the slightest evidence that organists were ever interested in historical registrations. Instead, the pieces would have been registered in an up-to-date fashion. We, of course, have a choice, within the limits of the instrument. Finally, a very important point: all the organs were unique. There was no standardization, unlike in France or Italy. In fact, the organs were expected to be unique, as in Germany (where the French-trained Gottfried Silbermann was criticized for making all his instruments alike). The registration directions we have are either very basic, geared toward beginning organists, or refer to specific instruments. Musicians then were expected to make intelligent choices based on local conditions; it would be historically inaccurate for us not to do the same.First, we consider how a player of the Santany\u00ed organ might have registered pieces in or after 1762; after that, we'll mention a few things about earlier registrations.There were three types of registration: undivided manuals (now calledbut then calledora slightly confusing term for us, but not really ambiguous. A \"tieno lleno\" called for an undivided registration, not a mixture (lleno = ple). For divided registrations (ora solo r.h. (\"tiple\" or \"mano derecha\") could be at 8' or 16' pitch\u2014below the written pitch of the accompanying l.h (which was always at 8'). Similarly, a solo l.h. (\"bax\u00f3n\" or \"mano izquierda\") could be at 8' or 4' or even 2', above the written pitch of the accompanying 8' r.h. This may seem counterintuitive at first.The Santany\u00ed organ originally had three manuals. There was no room for the echo division when the instrument was installed in its present location, and it was eventually destroyed.This is the original specifcation. Information on the echo manual is from. It was probably enclosed in a swell cabinet. Spanish names are from theof Gerhard Grenzing, who restored the instrument. Below are both the current Catalan labels and Grenzing's Spanish names to make it easier to interpret registration directions.USES: The above four stops can be used individually or in any combination. The Octava 4' is a compound stop; if used without a balancing 8', it is best suited for a r.h. solo. In some respects, the \"basic\" 8' is the open Flautat, while the \"basic\" 4' is the Tapadet.Registration and repertoire were both conservative. An anonymous registration treatise from the 1820s paraphrased Nassarre from the 1720s who, in turn, gave similar advice to that of Correa in the 1620s. But \"conservative\" doesn't mean \"static.\" In some important ways, the Santany\u00ed organ was a product of its time. No doubt, its players would have played earlier music with up-to-date registrations: these were the ones that made the best use of the instrument. But it is worth considering the differences between mid-18th century registrations and the ones that earlier composers would have had in mind.The two biggest differences between the Santany\u00ed organ and earlier organs were the mutation (aliquot) stops and the reeds.Earlier organs had individual mutation stops that could be built up to form a corneta or a ple, or added to a pre-existant small corneta or ple. There were often two or three small mixtures, a ple, a low simbalet, and a high simbalet.  The Santany\u00ed organ, like many of its time, has these already combined\u2014there isn't even an extant 2' flue stop. This is a great convenience for the player (who would want to pull the knobs for a 10-register corneta or a 24-register ple, and where could the knobs even fit?) but it means a loss of flexibility in registration. This characteristic might even be a survival from the early 16th century, when only the 8' and 4' registers had separated from the large Blockwerk that made up the basic organ sound. More likely, it is an evolutionary throwback.The wonderful array of reeds is extremely characteristic of the mid-18th century\u2014many older organs were updated with them, but the use of reeds in older music (which is most of what we play nowadays) was originally rather more restrained. The essential points are these: (1) Interior reeds appear early, from the mid-1500s, but only on large instruments. For about a hundred years, through the 1660s, they gradually become more common on smaller instruments, except in Catalonia and Valencia where they become less common. This includes stops with full-length resonators, such as the Trompeta Reial, and stops with short, untuned resonators, such as the Regalies. Stops of the Regalies and Dol\u00e7aina type were sometimes mounted on the outside of the case, perhaps horizontally, as early as this period. When Correa or Coelho specify \"clarines,\" they mean an interior stop, like the Trompeta Reial. The restrictions on the Regalies (do not use in pieces with a lot of chords, do not combine with other reeds) are only from the mid-eighteenth century onwards; they do not apply to any earlier period. But in the 17th century, the regalies were used as a solo only in the r.h. (2) Full-length horizonatal reeds first appear in the 1660s (1659, actually) and were soon adopted everywhere. The large catherdral organ in Valencia, the home instrument of Cabanilles, had no reeds at all until 1693, when a Trompeta Real and a treble Clar\u00edn were added. Cabanilles was 50 years old at the time, had travelled widely, and must have known about reeds from Castilian and possibly French organs, but he showed no interest in the major banks of reeds that were the norm outside of his home terrority. Catalonian and Valencian organs, in this respect, were 50 years behind the rest of the Iberian pennisula; they finally had major leng\u00fcetar\u00edas added in the 1720s through 1740s.A third difference between 18th century and earlier organs is a tendency for the earlier Catalan instruments to have two manuals while earlier Castilian instruments had divided registers on a single manual. This was only a tendency, and there were many exceptions, but the player should always consider the possibility of using two manuals rather than divided registers in Catalan music in the music of Cabanilles' predecessors (and, occasionally, in the music of Cabanilles as well).When registering pieces on the Santany\u00ed organ, players should consider the characteristics of the instrument. For example, it might seem historically appropiate to play a Cabanilles r.h. solo piece with the l.h. Ple and one r.h. exterior trumpet stop (Clarins 8' or Trompeta Batalla 8). But the Santany\u00ed's Ple is much larger than anything that Cabanilles had, so it is necessary to reinforce the treble, for example by using both 8' exterior trumpet stops together.On the web: two sites.gives the original specification for the Santany\u00ed organ but doesn't say where he got his information.reconstructed the organ as well as other Bosch organs. His site has details about these and other Spanish organs, also an interesting biography of Bosch and account of Grenzing's restoration of the organ in the Palacio Real, Madrid, redistributed in pdf format from the1993.As for books, on historical organs in general, an organ-restorer friend recommends:Andersen, Poul-Gerhard. 1969. Organ Building and Design. New York: Oxford University Press. Explains how historical organs were put together, along with a brief historical survey. Andersen was an actual organ builder, not a theoretician. This is an English translation of the first (1955/1956) edition of. There have been at least 5 subsequent editions, the most recent that I know of edited by Hanrik Fibiger N\u00f8rfelt, and published by the Dansk Organist- og Kantorsamfund in 1979. (Andersen died in 1980.) There are other books that are similar to this one\u2014one by Hans Klotz is mentioned below\u2014but I haven't seen them yet.There are three big books about historical registration. At least as far as Spanish organs are concerned, there is massive redundancy among these. They cite much the same sources and contain much the same information, but each has some unique information (and some unique errors). In terms of overall quality and usefulness, the progression goes from oldest to newest, thus showing that there is such a thing as progress in the field; but in spite of this, and some differences in emphasis, these are more alike than different, and all three are extremely good.Klotz, Hans. 1986. \u00dcber die Orgelkunst der Gotik, der Renaissance und des Barock. Kassel: B\u00e4renreiter. 3rd (and final; the author died the following year) ed. Klotz's other book,is well known, easy to get, and inexpensive, but I haven't read it. The 1986 work is out-of-print and very expensive, but summarizes a good selection of older registration lists. Nit: Klotz says (p. 263) that Castilian organs from 1640 to 1750 were characterized by a lack of individual mutation stops. I don't see this as a Castilian characteristic, and even the examples he gives do have individual mutation stops.Owen, Barbara. 1997. The registration of Baroque Organ music. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. Unlike the other two books, this is geared towards modern organists who want to understand historical registration and also play older music on their modern instruments. Easy to follow and easy to get (widely distributed and inexpensive). Has a few small errors (what doesn't?); here are two: The registration directions for the Segovia organ, 1770, do not say \"With Nasardos drawn in both hands one can play in four parts, providing that the music has a few rests [to change manuals or hand position?]\"\u2014Owen's confusion is evidenced by her question mark\u2014but \"... providing that the music has few rests,\" meaning \"a few rests,\" i.e., providing that there are four moving parts (p. 234). Also the registrations given for the Soler two-organ concertos on p. 233 are incomplete.Radole, Giuseppe. 2001. Le Registrazioni organistiche nelle culture europee dal 1500 al 2000. Udine: Pizzicato Edizioni Musicali. I think this is still in print (I'm using a library copy). Much easier to follow than Klotz, and has a few hints which may be useful for modern organists. Radole is unsympathetic to the organs with pre-composed mixtures and a lack of individual mutation stops which, in fact, were very different from the Italian organs he seems to prefer.A superb book on historical Spanish techniques for beginning organists is vol. 1,ed. Calvert Johnson, of the seriesgeneral editor Wayne Leopold. (1994, Boston: Wayne Leopold Editions, ECS Publishing). In addition to lots of information on historical organs and registration it contains information on historical fingerings, phrasing, etc. The bulk of the work consists of a series of graded and annotated pieces to teach the student historical techniques. Unfortunately, it is hard to get and expensive, but may be available from the(towards the bottom of the page). Otherwise, check your favorite used-book search engine or library.Some interesting information on the organs in the Valencia Catherdral is given in the biographical introduction to:Vol. 1, ed. Higinio Angl\u00e9s. (Biblioteca de Catalu\u00f1a: Barcelona, 1927). The Kalmus reprint doesn't have this instroduction, but the 1983 reprint by the Biblioteca de Catalu\u00f1a does (and it's a much better quality reprint, too).Barbara Brewster Hoag's dissertation \"The Performace Practice of Iberian Keyboard Music of the Seventeenth Century\" (New York University, 1980) has an extensive selection of source material about instruments, registration, fingerings, rhythms, ornamentation, etc.Finally, James Wyly seems to know more about historical Spanish registration than anybody else. His articles are listed in the books above.I am not an organist. My principle keyboard instruments are the harpsichord and clavichord, and my academic training is in historical musicology. Harpsichordists spend almost no time thinking about registration (and, in the case of Spanish harpsichords,no time, since the historical instruments almost entirely played 2\u00d78' all the time without changing registrations). Clavichordists, of course, don't have registrations to think about, and clavichords were of extreme importance to Spanish composers, since the clavichord was the standard practice instrument of every Spanish keyboard composer. (For detailed information on the construction of a modern clavichord based on an 18th-century Portuguese model, see.) Much of what we consider \"organ\" music must have been played, and played often, on the clavichord.Since I knew nothing about organ registration, it seemed natural to read up on historical registration practice and then summarize things in writing. I hope that other beginning organists find this page useful. Please send corrections, complaints, queries, and the like to me at <>."}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/mykeyboardbaby3.html", "content": "Well, I've been putting this off, since it can be bad luck. But the report must be made. Your clavichord is playing. It is in my living room as I write (we brought it across the street just ahead of the rainstorm).  It is, dare one say it, a WONDERFUL clavichord. The pitch-center and cleanliness of the notes, without flutter or wobble, is the best I've ever done. Top treble in iron is gorgeous. Wound strings in the bass are clean with good pitch center. Extraordinarily easy to play. Not flabby-easy, but quit-obsessing-and-look-at-the-damned-score,-relax-and-play-the-damned-music easy. The rather massive bridge makes for a smooth, elegant cleanliness, rather that a lot of raw volume, but my wife says I'm crazy, and that she can hum along to it two rooms away in the kitchen.Clavichord is at the exasperating stage of getting the action played-in (read: getting all the keys going up and down consistently). If you get impatient and make everything really free right away, you usually end up with a clattery action. But we're getting there.  I am now making minor adjustments in the stringing strategy.  The bass, though not booming and spectacular like a piano or harpsichord or 12-foot-long Lindholm or Hass, plays cleanly and beautifully all the way down to FF!  And, more important, this extra range makes the notes you reallyplay work so much better. The figures around C that turn up in the Inventions are much smoother and cleaner than on the smaller clavichords, where you're playing the very bottom notes.Just changed a few of the strings that were on my \"to-do\" list (beefed up tenor c/c# and d/d# one gauge), with very pleasing results. Gradually the rough edges and inconsistencies are working themselves out, and I find myself obsessing over details less and playing more. This design is one that I plan to recommend to almost anybody I can persuade to seek a clavichord.The lid plan had been an oak frame of pieces about 1/2\" thick and around 2\" wide. Single big lid, as on the original. I had planned for a very thin panel insert of light spruce. But my neighbor, who was over tonight, insists that the panel should be paper-thin quartered oak to match the frame, and, since the clavichord itself has such a clean \"arts and crafts-era\" look about it, this might be the better way to go.The lid should get the nice little iron hinges [] mounted today.  I still have some stringing issues to resolve (trial applications of some string-revision hypotheses have yielded very pleasing results), and one or two keys that must improve their mechanical function. Cranked key levers are difficult, and I would, upon reflection, see this aspect as the only conceivable impediment to viewing large-ish fretted clavichords as the best possible examples of the instrument.The lid already has a preliminary oil finish, which will have no practical negative impact on the process of doing a motto. The inside panel will be finished with a matte sealer varnish, either oil-based or even lacquer-based (ok, I'll admit it, DEFT), which can be painted on with an appropriate lettering paint.  Yesterday I finally got the lid/hinges mounted, and some ribbon on to hold the thing up, and it certainly focusses the sound nicely. I plan to do some key levelling and \"voicing\" of tangents today, but will mostly probably play the thing.Got a visit from [Famous Harpsichordist], whom we'd never met before. I found him delightful, and he played the devil out of my instruments without whimpering about differences among octave spans or nano-irregularities in regulation. And he completely blew me away on your new clavichord. Claims he doesn't own one and hasn't played clavichord, but you could have fooled me. He visited accompanied by a festival-goer ... and was about to leave after a good visit and playing harpsichords, when his travel companion asked him to play the clavichord. When he was done (a really stunning run-through of the JSB Chromatic Fantasy), he turned to me and said \"Why would anybody ever want to play a harpsichord after that?\""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/dissertation/abstract.html", "content": ""}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/index.html", "content": "If you came here looking for information on human trafficking in East Africa, you actually want to go, since I don't know anything about it."}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/mykeyboardbaby2.html", "content": "Balance pins are the metal pins the keys rock on on the balance rail. These are soft iron plated with very smooth chromium or something like that. Guide pins are the tongues of this or that at thetail-ends of the keys that ride up and down in the rack slots. On yours, and the last several instruments, they are of lignum vitae, which wears like crazy and is self-lubricating, releasing, as it does, its own oil.  Used a lot for the bearings on the drive shafts of ocean-going ships, and also for gears and shafts and bearings on water wheels, where it stays oily while submerged. Backrail felt is two layers, for quiet. It is from a very old blanket we bought at an estate sale years ago. It is white, but at one end has big blue lettering that says \"U.S. Navy Medical Department.\" Nice touch. Very quiet, thick, lovely wool. First layer is glued down to the back rail. Second layer right now is just sitting there, but I'll probably give it some restraint. Don't like to nail it, because it makes the level uneven with little tufted humps. Two-sided tape works great, holds well enough and doesn't change the function or levelness of the backrail ... and it's reversable.The thing is starting to look like a clavichord! And the keys are very silent.I gave [my new] dust-collector a run for its money resawing some Englemann spruce for the soundboard. I bought it once out of the trunk of a tuna boat in a McDonald's parking lot on the freeway near Salem. The resawing usually leaves a snowstorm of dust like the asbestos in a WWII shipyard, and a pile about 6 inches deep on the floor, and the crud makes the saw cut poorly and makes it hard to see what you're doing.  [But with the dust collector, there was] hardly a crumb anywhere to be seen.The back of the board as it finally ended up. With each additional rib, the thing got zippier, by the way. \"Zippier\" is sort of hard to explain, but not even remotely subtle if you're there. When the board is finished being planed, even with great wood glued with hide glue and sized with same, and to nice thickness, etc., tapping still elicits something relatively soggy and dull. Like wet cardboard (or a finished sitka spruce harpsichord soundboard?!). At this point I find myself tapping constantly and feeling a little bit anxious. Then you glue on the bridge, and tapping makes louder and higher-pitched sounds, butthe bridge itself still elicits pretty wooly sounds. Then as each rib goes on (and as the residual moisture from the glue works itself out over the course of several days) tapping elicits brighter and louder noises, until the final thing which gives the final boost occurs, which is restraining the edges when you actually glue in the board. The good news is that the board always sounds brighter and more responsive the day after it's glued in than it did being held in the hands before installation.  There is always a pleasant surprise when you take off the go-bars. By zippier: the closest analogy to what you hear is rubbing or tapping your finger over the mesh or even directly over the diaphragm of an operating microphone.  Right now, if I tap or rub my finger on, say, the outer case wall or molding of the clavichord, you hear absolutely nothing. If I do the same thing, with no more energy, to the bridge, you can hear it 20 or 30 feet away.Strips of cloth - muslin soaked in hide glue, as a matter of fact (known around here as \"18th-century fiberglass\") - help strengthen the fragile joint at the tips, where the ribs are tapered literally down to nothing. These points can, under stress, become fulcra of the ends of the ribs, so the cloth helps strengthen things there. The ones without cloth don't terminate in spots from which they're likely to lever themselves, so the cloth is less necessary. I could have used some, but the area was stiff enough already. Upholstery tacks are driven up into pre-drilled holes on the underside of the bridge. A venerable practice of many of the old guys. I once made the mistake of doing a \"dry run\" with the tacks on a clavichord bridge - without glue, of course - and had to use a pry-bar to get the damned thing off so I could glue it back down.  Clavichord bridges are under horrific shearing strains, much worse than harpsichord bridges, and have been known to be torn loose, so we can use all the insurance we can get. The ribs are of soundboard wood. In this case I used true fir (spp. abies), even though the sounboard itself is Englemann spruce (spp. picea). Why? Just 'cause. I think that if the ribs are cut-out where they pass under the bridge you don't create nasty or dead spots as Hubbard claimed occured in cross-ribbed Italians. My Vaudry and my big Giusti [harpsichords] are both ribbed this way. Clavichord soundboards work better, I think, when they're relatively stiff and the strings don't have to drive big flabby, unsupported areas.The little rib is analogous to the little one shown by Brauchli, but further from the tangent to the arc of the treble part of the bridge (in Brauchli's picture the little rib almost touches where the bridge is - though see below). My first several clavichords, using standard ribbing, eventually developed quite a trough between the treble hook of the bridge and the belly rail. The little rib, of course, fixes this, and provides a springy energy-storing thing to boost the treble into the bargain. I stole the idea shamelessly directly from the Edinburgh Hubert clavichord.  What I stole in particular from Hubert was cutting out the liner and projecting the little rib back up into that area (without touching the liner) so it pivots from within the line of the liner, which is to say that it doesn't pivot at all. The ribbing patterns in Brauchli's article I will take as being on the originals, but the placement, I think, is probably conceptual and schematic, and doesn't show anything about actual placement. It can't, because the long diagonal rib he shows on Manuel's instrument would have to pierce right through the pinblock.As I said, big day. A nice, warm sunny springtime day. It is claimed that such days are to be selected for gluing in soundboards because they make it easy to bias the humidity to the low-end for gluing-in. My suspicion is that they're suitable because gluing in a soundboard takes little actual time, and requires that one just go away and leave the damned thing alone for the better part of a day, and what better time to do that than a day suitable for hanging about outdoors?"}, {"page": "http://dustyfeet.com/evil/parasite.html", "content": "WHAT IS THE BARNEY CREATURE? It is not a purple dinosaur. In, the most brilliant thing ever published in the(sadly, in their first issue, but life is often like that) the biologists Edward Theriot and Earle Sapamer demonstrate that it is a primate, to which they assign the name Pretendosaurus barneyi. In spite of the zoological (i.e., bad) Latin, the name is apt, because Barney's public persona is a lie.\"BARNEY IS WHOLESOME\" claim the Creature's defenders. Theriot and Sapamer note that it is always associated with human children (in fact, although they do not point this out, the word \"barney\" means \"island of children\" in Norse). They speculate that it survives by integrating itself into this protected ecological niche. Unfortunately, there is a more sinister explanation. Barney's teeth are clearly those of a carnivore (its mother, Sheryl Leach, fashioned it after a Tyrranosaurus rex). There is no reason to doubt the Creature's professed love for children, but the form that its love takes may not be in the children's best interests. Note well that very, very small and tender children know enough to be scared by Barney.BARNEY IS SERIOUSLY NOT GOOD FOR KIDS, arguearticle and other articles listed. No surprise; Barney was, as something to mesmerize children so that they could be parked in front of the tv. \"You don't understand,\" the negligent adults whine. \"KidsBarney.\" Sure they do; they love to play in the toilet bowl, too. But for some reason, parents find brown poop disgusting, even though they'll snarf up purple poop. Well, not all parents. One wrote (on the, \"Hi. I am 33 yrs old with 3 daughters. Two years ago, we had Barney over for a birthday party. When he left, he almost got hit by a car. We all cracked up.\"BARNEY IS TO CHILDREN AS OSAMA BIN LADEN IS TO ISLAM. The children are an excuse, the innocent means to a perverse end. Barney's true prey is adults or at least their money. The claim of wholesomeness would be more convincing if the Barney Creature were not soan astonishing array of merchandise, and if its creators were not so. The Creature's profits have already been the subject of the stupidly named \"\" (summary: PBS subsidizes Barney, partly with taxpayer money, while Barney's parents stuff their pockets), but\u00a0 Sheryl Leach's tender maternal instincts did not preclude her. \"I love you, you sell me.\"MORE! MORE! The Barney Creature is a voracious, bottomless pit. All who oppose it with ridicule must be destroyed. The Barney Creature's weapon of choice is the Legal Absurdity which seems to have been honed to a dull edge by a Darwinian process - that is, with no controlling intelligence\u00a0 - and the Creature wields it with the finesse of Wile E. Coyote\u00ae. First the Barney Creature took aim at a chicken, and shot itself twice. The San Diego Chicken, in costume, would beat up Barney, also in costume, for entertainment. Barney sued, and the fight was metaphorically re-enacted in the courtoom, as a federal\u00a0 judgeEager for another beating, Barney appealed, and wound up having to pay the chicken's legal costs.THE BARNEY CREATURE THEN CHANGED TACTICS, figuring that if it couldn't beat a single opponent, it might have better luck again a multitude, so it sent out inane but scaryagainst websites, threatening suit for trademark and copyright infringement. A legal analysis of these absurdities is. These succeeded in scaring enough people that thenow reads like a cemetery of dead links. But people whoto the Creature were able to face it down easily. Then, emboldened by this Pyrrhic vicory, it has started a sending out a new round of inane but scary letters, this time threatening to complain to the websites' Internet Service Providers. A non-legal analysis can be found. The Creature's follow-up letter with a non-legal analysis can be found; a legal analysis can be found. The Creature's tactic, for perhaps the first time, actually makes sense - the Creature has been beaten up so badly in court that it has finally learned to try its case in a non-legal venue, such as an ISP.Will the Creature succeed this time?
