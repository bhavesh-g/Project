Before the Kaplan Institute opened in October 2018, furniture companyand Chairman of the Boardprovided the finishing touch\u2014a donation of $1.7 million in new furniture.Steelcase, based out of Grand Rapids, Michigan, is the largest supplier of office furniture in the world. In addition to being Steelcase board chair, Pew is also the founding chair of the Institute of Design Board of Advisors, a role he held twice between 1989 and 2016. This isn't the first time Pew and Steelcase have provided Illinois Tech with furniture. When the Institute of Design (ID) moved from Mies Campus to downtown Chicago in 1997, Steelcase gifted ID with $1 million in office goods\u2014along with a special tenant deal in the building it owned at 350 North LaSalle Street, amounting to $6 million in free and discounted rent. This most recent gift brings the relationship full circle, as ID has moved back to Mies Campus and into its new home in the Kaplan Institute.Pew is a member of the Philip Danforth Armour Society, which recognizes families who have made transformational gifts of $1 million or more in support of the university's mission. In fact, Pew's family has given more than $10 million to Illinois Tech, and Steelcase is ID's largest corporate donor.\"Steelcase has been a generous donor to ID, but Steelcase gets as much out of the relationship as ID does,\" Pew explains. \"We've hired many talented ID graduates over the years, and our company's ability to stay ahead of competitors has benefited from the design leadership coming out of ID.\"The Steelcase furniture in the Kaplan Institute solves problems posed by traditional classrooms. A portion of the desks come from the Steelcase Bivi line, popular in professional design firms and open-plan offices. Bivi desks can easily be clustered in modules of six to eight workspaces to foster collaboration and have integrated power and communications systems. Other desks and chairs Steelcase has provided can be quickly moved and reconfigured throughout the building for different purposes and stacked for high-density storage. Most important, this new furniture will provide the flexibility for students and faculty to engage in the collaborative, interdisciplinary design work that embodies the mission of the Kaplan Institute.Besides furniture and rental spaces, Pew and Steelcase have helped ID in other ways. The Steelcase/Robert C. Pew Endowed Chair in Design supports the work of Distinguished Professor Patrick Whitney, considered one of the most respected leaders in the human-centered design movement. Pew also established the Charles Owen Endowed Professorship, which has supported Professor, a well-known expert in systems design.Institute of Design Dean(M.Des.

Known as the Frank-Starling Law of the Heart, it is as accepted as gravity and, like gravity, is still not fully understood. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, Thomas Irving from Illinois Tech's College of Science and Pieter de Tombe from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine discovered that the protein titin may play a critical role in the nano-science behind Frank-Starling. Blood enters the heart during its diastolic phase, when cardiac muscle is relaxed and lengthened. As the heart pumps and enters into its systolic phase, the muscle forcefully contracts through the interaction of myosin and actin protein filaments. Titin serves as a kind of elastic band that stores energy when cardiac muscle is stretched and releases energy when the muscle contracts and shortens. Irving and de Tombe learned that the action of titin pulling on the myosin filaments causes changes that ultimately result in increased strength of muscle contraction when muscle is stretched when the heart fills in the diastolic phase.It's been said that some people resemble their pets and with that in mind, Brent Stephens, IIT assistant professor of architectural engineering, likens the structure of a building to its human inhabitants to help explain the diagnostic work that he does.

The recent(J. John Wu and Robert D. Atkinson, Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, 2017) calculates that the number of technology-based startups in the United States grew 47 percent in the last decade, and that these new firms have been making an outsized contribution to economic growth.Angel investors are an early step in a tech venture's path to success. For the last 10 years as members of the, we have been investing in commercializing tech startups founded by university students. Our investments focus on companies that distinguish themselves in both their innovation and entrepreneurship. Here are the three factors we look for in making an investment and how the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship\u2014by specifically equipping Illinois Tech students with teachable skills in entrepreneurship and innovation\u2014will be preparing students to chart a successful course for their futures:Opportunities abound to establish tech startups that do no more than create a work-around to a problem by offering a faster, better, or cheaper approach.The most successful tech startups are disruptors based on revolutionary ideas that are obsolescing and not simply evolutionary and/or incremental. They offer new solutions, not just work-arounds.The Kaplan Institute was specifically formed to create an environment for students to develop new solutions that promise radical change as part of their Illinois Tech experience. Our students will develop the essential skills, obtain the critical feedback, and engage in real-world projects that will enable them to achieve consequential business and social breakthroughs. In this way, our graduates can achieve impressive outcomes at a much faster pace and be more effective employees and contributors immediately upon graduation.An authentically passionate team, whose creativity, determination, and value exceeds that of the individual team members, is what separates the best startups from the rest of the pack. The team's hard capabilities and soft capabilities, especially the intangible team-wide commitment to succeed, are critical to a startup's success. This balance is core to our angel investment decisions.In Illinois Tech's Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program, now housed at the Kaplan Institute, diverse teams collaborate to solve challenging and important business and societal problems. The Kaplan Institute's leadership programs provide practical hands-on experience in collaboration, setting direction, and resolving conflicts.We look for business teams that have already benefited from a learn-by-doing-and-screwing-up approach. They know how to adapt to unexpected situations while staying on course. We seek teams that can adjust, pivot, and overcome the insurmountable. Hitting the wall, adapting, and persevering must be core competencies. Tech-enabled innovations depend most on the team's ability to rapidly sense the unexpected, adapt, and prosper. We have seen this capability demonstrated in many startups, with products as diverse as a prenatal intubator, a virtual-reality surgical prep program, and a touchscreen optimized for all-weather conditions on gas pumps, to name just a few.The Kaplan Institute's experiential learning methodology is founded on an iterative try-learn-improve approach. This prepares graduates for a world where the written plan is only good until the unanticipated happens. Graduates will know how to adapt and adjust rapidly to ever-changing realities around them. This is great life preparation, no matter what path graduates take after Illinois Tech."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/contact", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2018/von-steuben-students-participate-opt4stem-energy-academy", "content": "A group of high school students from Chicago's Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center had an eight-day opportunity this summer to explore power in various forms through theEnergy Academy.

As head AT, Wehde is part of a select group. In the most recent (2014) national longitudinal study that tracked women's participation in intercollegiate sports, only 32.4 percent of women held head AT positions across all three divisions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.Read an Online Exclusive Q&A with Wehde at magazine.iit.edu, where she shares information about mentorship, career challenges, and the personal attributes that make for a strong sports leader.I grew up in Illinois in a small town called Ingleside, a little lake town in northern Illinois. I also grew up with two brothers. My younger brother followed me in the health care industry and graduated from pharmacy school this past June.I did play sports growing up. My best friend in grade school actually took me to a soccer practice with her were we were about 6 years old. From that point forward I played soccer through college. I tried several other sports growing up as well, including volleyball, basketball, and running. Sports have always been a big part of my life and taught me determination and discipline.I was very much on a direct path into athletic training when I started at Aurora University for my undergraduate degree. I chose Aurora University based on a few things, but the most important points for me were its strong nationally accredited athletic training program and the opportunity to play collegiate soccer.I decided while in high school that I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field, but was not sure I could afford the time and financial investments of medical school. After personally sustaining a few significant sports injuries I was exposed to athletic training and thought it was a perfect blend of medicine and sports. Athletic training seemed like a perfect fit\u2014I could combine it with sports, which was an important part of my life, and with medicine.I have had many mentors along the way. I believe surrounding myself with strong mentors has helped me become successful. Most significant in my professional development were two athletic trainers I had the privilege of working with as a student and as a professional, Nicki Pieart and Jen Robbins. Both of these individuals have been a constant positive influence in my life, professionally and personally.Nicki made me recognize the importance of constantly improving my knowledge base all around and particularly in athletic training and collegiate athletics. She possesses a strength, intelligence, and competitiveness for athletic training and professionalism that I have always admired. She is often the person I rely on for professional questions and guidance. Jen has also been a strong influence in my life. Her strengths are in her ability to never give up on a task and her knowledge of the business side of any profession. She has always provided me direction in personal and professional planning and decision making.I carry a lot of determination, intelligence, compassion, and competitiveness that have helped me advance in many aspects of my life and career. I work hard for my success and learn from my failures, much like the athletes I work with every day. I have always put myself into leadership roles through athletics, academics, and now, in my career. I appreciate the end result of reaching goals as an individual and as a team. I think this is why I have always strived to lead.I will admit at times I do struggle to balance work and life, but I love what I do. I work with athletes that have a like-minded drive to succeed and I get to be around sports all of the time. Many days it does not feel like work. I do prioritize time with friends, family, and travel. I think spending time enjoying the people I care about and the activities I enjoy is an important balance. Working hard is necessary but appreciating life is also a top priority.I have faced many challenges along the way. I think one of the most significant is a challenge many athletic trainers face: having to deliver unwelcome news regarding an athlete's playing status. Some coaches take that news as an obstacle they need to adapt to and some have a difficult time processing that the star athlete may not be able to play in the next game. In these situations, as the person responsible for the student-athlete's health and well-being, it is my job to stand up for the athlete and make a difficult decision to protect their safety.I think we all experience stereotyping in one way or another. I believe that I have been lucky enough that there have been a lot of very successful and admirable women that have preceded me and laid a foundation to minimize gender stereotyping. I realize I work in a field that had previously been male dominant and still is in some areas; however, I feel my co-workers and students have respected me as a colleague who has worked hard for my achievements.I have worked with many different sports and athletes. I have seen a wide array of injuries in my career from fractures to ACL [anterior cruciate ligament] and other ligament tears to heat illnesses, nagging tendonitis, and stress reactions. My education and experience has equipped me to handle a large variety of injuries and health related issues. I cannot say that one particular thing has been especially predominant or that any particular condition is isolated to Division III athletics.I grew up about 45 minutes outside of Chicago.

Although he ultimately ended up studying civil engineering rather than architecture, Patel says he wouldn't trade his college years for anything. Which is why it's no surprise he ended up coming back to his alma mater two years later to accept a career development coach position in the Career Services Office.\"After graduation, I went to Vermont and began my career in the undergraduate admissions office at Champlain College,\" Patel says. \"I had started a master's program at the University of Vermont and planned to finish my master's thesis remotely, from Chicago.

He helped recruit companies to the career fair events and coached students about their futures. But Patel knew he wanted more.\"As a career coach, it was difficult to see alumni only come back to the university when they needed help. I wasn't seeing alumni celebrate their successes and talk about the great things they've done,\" he says. \"Our alumni are doing amazing things, but they don't always think about how they can come back to share their news.\"Patel recently saw an opportunity to change that when he accepted a new role at the university as director of alumni engagement and giving programs in 2018. \"I see this position as an opportunity to help alumni connect with the university because I'm an alumnus myself; I understand what alumni are looking for. This is personal for me. It's less of a job and more of engaging with people who share the same background as me,\" Patel says.This fall he will begin traveling around the country hosting alumni events in various regions.\"The Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship is the most exciting thing happening on campus right now,\" he says, \"and the plan is to bring that excitement on the road and to share the new building and programs with people who can't necessarily come to campus to see it in person.\" Patel also plans to increase college collaboration and grow the alumni online community and available resources.\"The thing I'm most excited about in this new position is the relationships that I'll build with alumni. I'm looking forward to being able to connect them with their fellow alumni and students\u2014future alumni,\" Patel says. \"I hope that my phone will be filled with new contacts and people I can reach out to who want to make Illinois Tech an even better place.\"Contact Akshar Patel ator 312.567.7149 to discuss new ideas for alumni events, collaboration opportunities, and networking initiatives.

After all, as he notes, people and their buildings spend about 90 percent of their time together.\"The structure of the building is the skeleton of a body, the air-distribution system is the lungs, the electrical system is the central nervous system,\" he says, before adding the last of the list with a smile. \"And the plumbing system, well, is the plumbing system.\"The affable Stephens along with a team composed of five IIT graduate students, several undergraduates, and one post-doctoral researcher focus on a building's lungs, so to speak, through the Built Environment Research Group. Stephens, who founded the group when he came to IIT almost three years ago, has already garnered plenty of media attention (for his findings on 3-D printer emissions and Metra exhaust hazards) and more than $1 million in funding from government and industry organizations, including his most recent grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for $500,000 over a three-year period.At the request of the EPA, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the health branch of the National Academy of Sciences, summarized the current scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air and health. In June 2011, the IOM issued the report \"Climate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health,\" in which it issued three key findings: Poor indoor environmental quality is creating health problems today, climate change may worsen existing indoor problems and introduce new ones, and there are opportunities to improve public health while mitigating or adapting to alterations in indoor environmental quality induced by climate change.The IIT group will be measuring and modeling the amount of outdoor pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter (from sources such as diesel and gas-engine exhaust, plant emissions, wildfire dust, vehicular wear-and-tear from roadways) in homes across the country. Phase 1 will involve performing hourly indoor air quality modeling of indoor exposures to both indoor-generated pollutants and outdoor-infiltrated pollutants across the U.S. residential building stock under both current and future meteorological conditions.\"We can do a decent job of understanding how we think the hourly weather will change. But there's also the indirect impact, which is, in response to climate change, we are changing the way we build our buildings; we retrofit more buildings. With more aggressive climate policies, you get more incentives for energy-efficiency retrofits to try to bring energy use down because buildings are such an integral source of emissions of COand other greenhouse gases,\" explains Stephens, who had conducted a much smaller study of 20 homes in Austin, Texas, where he completed his graduate studies.\"The oldest, leakiest buildings I had measured there\u2014and one of them was my home\u2014had the highest amount of outdoor pollutant transport indoors. The newest, tightest, most energy-efficient, net-zero-energy home had the least amount. It was a huge difference, at about a factor of 20,\" he says.Phase 2 of the project will then be conducted with the help of the Historic Chicago Bungalow Association, an organization created in 2000 by Mayor Richard M. Daley to help preserve the one and one-half story, brick-faced and stone-trimmed homes that still characterize many neighborhoods in the city and suburbs. Stephens will measure about 30 homes for ozone, particulate matter, and NOboth before and after the bungalows receive energy-efficiency improvements through the Retrofit Chicago Single-Family Residential Partnership program.Built Environment Research Group:Report on \"Climate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/autopian-algorithms", "content": "An automotive Utopia (\"Autopia\") of driverless vehicles may be the key to safer roads, better fuel efficiency, and smoother traffic flow. By moving you at higher speeds, it might even shorten your commute.But, in order to function optimally, it will also require you to relinquish the steering wheel because, according to transportation scientists, an algorithm is a better driver than you. It's immune to distraction and, when built into a connected-vehicle system, is designed to make decisions that benefit everyone on the highway.\"Currently people use Google Maps to check roads for traffic and then each driver makes route decisions independently. We want to build a mechanism that collaborates with other connected vehicles on the road and mathematically program a solution that everybody is happy with,\" says Lili Du, assistant professor of transportation engineering, who recently received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to develop algorithms that reduce traffic congestion by coordinating vehicle route choices.Such collaboration requires autonomous (driverless) vehicles, which will actually follow the software's directions. That's because people can choose to ignore instructions, explains Du.Du is also a member of \"The Driverless City\" project team, one of three selected to participate in the first phase of Illinois Tech's Nayar Prize I. As such she is working on algorithms to address decisions about lane choice, vehicle speed, and following distance (the amount of space left between your vehicle and the one in front of you).\"When traffic is congested, we speed up and then we stop. That causes excess emissions and traffic accidents,\" Du says. \"Our algorithm would help each vehicle react to traffic disturbance or fluctuation properly. As a result, we can keep each vehicle in efficient motion while making the traffic flow more stable.\"Some experts suggest an Autopian future will arrive as early as 2023, but Du says it will largely depend on society's acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Driverless cars are legal in four states (Nevada, California, Michigan, Florida) and Washington, D.C.; another 20 states (Illinois is one of them) are considering similar laws.The coming Autopia must also address cybersecurity to prevent hackers from taking over individual vehicles or the entire network, and that issue may take a few years to work out.Yet an Autopian future will indeed arrive, ironically, by dismissing the driver."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/titin-titan", "content": "For more than 100 years, a basic physiological tenet has ruled cardiac function: A healthy beating heart will pump out the same amount of blood that it receives. Known as the Frank-Starling Law of the Heart, it is as accepted as gravity and, like gravity, is still not fully understood. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, Thomas Irving from Illinois Tech's College of Science and Pieter de Tombe from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine discovered that the protein titin may play a critical role in the nano-science behind Frank-Starling.Blood enters the heart during its diastolic phase, when cardiac muscle is relaxed and lengthened. As the heart pumps and enters into its systolic phase, the muscle forcefully contracts through the interaction of myosin and actin protein filaments. Titin serves as a kind of elastic band that stores energy when cardiac muscle is stretched and releases energy when the muscle contracts and shortens. Irving and de Tombe learned that the action of titin pulling on the myosin filaments causes changes that ultimately result in increased strength of muscle contraction when muscle is stretched when the heart fills in the diastolic phase.\"The missing piece in all of this is how the one protein talks to the other,\" says Irving, whose team's findings were published in the(February 23, vol. 113, no. 8). \"We have a bunch of candidates in mind and will try to track them down over the next couple of years, at which time we should have a pretty complete story about the Frank-Starling mechanism.\"This past spring the National Institutes of Health awarded Irving, who is also director of the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT), $6.3 million to continue this work and other projects at the Advanced Photon Source.Not only does titin take the top honor of being the world's largest-known protein, but it also has the longest name in the nomenclature of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). That \"titin\" is derived from \"Titan,\" one of the giant deities from Greek mythology, is no surprise.

One of his wishes is that every alumnus and alumna will someday come back to see how IIT has changed. And it's about taking a look beyond Main Campus. John wants IIT alumni to visit the new South Side\u2014to see how the university has connected with the surrounding area, including Bronzeville, too.In this issue of, you will read about the history of IIT's Bronzeville neighborhood and how it flourished in the early twentieth century. During these formative years Bronzeville made significant social and cultural advances in African-American history. At the same time, IIT was a growing university already contributing to advances in innovation and technology. Independently, both IIT and Bronzeville were history makers in their own right!As a South Side kid, although I did not live in Bronzeville, I was very familiar with IIT and its neighborhood. In the late 1950s, before I was born, my parents were students at IIT and lived in apartment 711 in Bailey Hall. They told me how very proud they were of IIT as an educational institution and how much they enjoyed sharing their lives with fellow students from around the world and with their colleagues from Bronzeville. Little did they know that two of their children would one day be products of IIT's pre-collegiate Early Identification Program, which attracted many African-American students to the university.A lot has changed since I graduated in 1984. Back then some of us felt that there was no real connection between our campus and Bronzeville. And, for some of us who had an \"urban tale\" to tell, the campus served as the neighborhood oasis for students.Today, you can feel the passion for IIT to have a connection. When I returned to the university to serve on the alumni board, I was astounded by the transformation. Now, we relate the Starbucks on the corner of 35th and State and residents jogging in the park as clear signs of urban renewal. There is a new Metra stop by campus, the old Comiskey Park is now U.S. Cellular Field, the MTCC student center is a campus gathering place, and Bronzeville continues to experience its own renaissance\u2014with IIT as a partner in its progress. These things make our neighborhood one of the most beautiful areas on the South Side.Although a lot has changed at IIT, much of what makes IIT special hasn't changed at all. We still continue to attract the best and brightest students from this country and all over the world, and our faculty and alumni remain global innovators, making significant contributions worldwide.During this 125th anniversary year, I hope you will return to campus to see what's different.

Carr of Dahl-Stedman Company handled the management of construction of buildings at Illinois Institute of Technology for [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe, who was associated with architects Holabird & Root.

It is time now to co-author the next chapter of Illinois Tech's story.Looking ahead, my vision for Illinois Tech is that we will become:In short, we will be a premier global technological university that is based in Chicago.All of us need to write that next chapter for it is only by working together that we can realize our goals.First, we must ensure the success of our graduates by offering them a total student experience. This will include a great education in a discipline of their choice and an out-of-class experience that will allow them to grow as people, develop an appreciation of the accomplishments of others, and start on the path that will allow them to become leaders in their careers.Second, we must continue to build the visibility of our university as a premier global technological university in Chicago, in the United States, and across the world.Third, we must build a community that supports the achievement of our goals. We must ensure that our university values all of its members\u2014and that diversity and inclusion are hallmarks of our community.And fourth, we must grow. Growth in all areas is necessary: growth in student numbers, growth in stature, growth in academics, growth in scholarship and research, and growth in pride. This includes pride in the accomplishments of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends.Our future is tied to strong undergraduate enrollment and our continued ability to attract some of the best and brightest graduate students and researchers from around the world. I ask for your help to identify students who could benefit from an Illinois Tech education and to tell the Illinois Tech story with pride. To our alumni, let us know when you do something exciting so that we can share it proudly across the institution.In the years ahead you will hear me use the words 'celebrate' and 'share' together. We have much to celebrate\u2014faculty recognition, student achievement, alumni accomplishments, and staff service.

We are more powerful if we identify opportunities where we can collectively be more impactful as a college of architecture by way of strategic collaborations with the Institute of Design or Armour College [of Engineering], for example. While the very nature of education is specialized, the learning process does not stop at colleges.I am a big proponent of the built environment. When you say 'architecture' instead of 'built environment,' you're putting all of the agency on the architect; whereas we all know that architects are hugely important in many aspects leading up to the design, you need great collaborators in engineers, landscape architects, urban planners (just to name a few), in order to make anything really work. So I would stress built environment over architecture with a capital. That's a bit of a provocation, I understand. But when you think about it, roads and infrastructure are equally as important as the buildings.We have various degree programs in the College of Architecture, but we also have the M.L.A. + U [landscape architecture and urbanism] program. When we talk about the legacy of the College of Architecture, I think we tend to give almost too much importance to [Ludwig] Mies [van der Rohe]. He was certainly an innovator of huge impact, but he was also a man who collaborated. Three greats have influenced us at the school\u2014Mies, Ludwig Hilberseimer, and Alfred Caldwell. Lafayette Park\u2014a residential neighborhood realized in Detroit during the late 1950s and 1960s\u2014is the result of a collaboration between them.My ambition is to think carefully about what it means to be a global architect today. To be a global architect you actually have to experiment with a local context that you learn from to apply your skills to other contexts. Take, for example, when Mies came to this city. Gary, Indiana, was a huge producer of steel. It was not only that Mies loved steel as an aesthetic, but the proximity to Gary also made the choice affordable.If one thinks of a building only in terms of aesthetics, you really don't understand the context. Mies learned from America, and America learned from him. Being in Chicago was hugely important for him\u2014he used what he learned in Europe, took it forward, and increased his oeuvre."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/category/campus?page=1", "content": "Vida Winans, director of Illinois Tech's Computer Discovery Camp for Middle School Girls, describes the evolution of the camp, which has doubled in enrollment since it was founded in 2010 and is now so popular that it has a waiting list.

Come sunrise, the same forces that spur its shimmering bands will likely wreak havoc with communication systems and GPS navigation.Each time the sun beams a solar flare or lobs a coronal mass ejection (CME) toward our planet, a surge of charged particles strips electrons from gases in our atmosphere, resulting in the familiar glow and also dense plasma masses that refract, or delay, satellite signals.Predicting where this plasma will travel remains one of the challenges of space weather forecasting. Now, with the help of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, Seebany Datta-Barua, assistant professor of aerospace engineering, hopes to shift the science closer to becoming as accurate as meteorologists' storm tracking.\"Say there is a CME headed toward Earth. It strikes our magnetosphere and some of the particles get rerouted into Earth's upper atmosphere. Where will those particles go? It would be helpful if we could forecast whether they will be mostly visible over Australia or the U.S., or not affect anyone at all,\" Datta-Barua says. \"It would allow airlines and electric-power suppliers to plan for it and take appropriate action.\"Datta-Barua will use mathematical modeling of the plasma densities to detect something called Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), which can help scientists predict where\u2014and how quickly\u2014particles will move from one location to another.LCS have been used successfully to model the movement of pollutants in the ocean. If Datta-Barua can detect their presence in the atmosphere, she can use them to model where the plasma will gather over our planet following a solar event.\"The idea is to pretend you're following one particle in the flow through time, and then you follow another particle nearby to see how far they separate over time. Do that for a lot of neighboring points and a pattern emerges where some particles start off close together and then diverge quickly. Yet in another region, they stay close,\" Datta-Barua says. \"An LCS is like a wall that divides the particles that separated most rapidly. It defines a barrier that tells us something like, 'Two particles that start on either side of this barrier will go far apart from each other after five hours.'\"The entire dance plays out in the ionosphere, an ever-shifting layer of charged particles within the thermosphere, which has interested Datta-Barua since her days as an undergraduate studying physics at Stanford University. While doing undergraduate research, she found her interest shifting from fundamental physics to a desire to pursue science that directly affects people's daily lives. So, along with a bachelor's degree in physics, Datta-Barua went on to earn a master's degree and doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics, and participated in the GPS Research Laboratory run by Stanford Professor Per Enge.\"Aerospace engineering and working with the near-space environment\u2014satellites and all the technologies that rely on them like communications, navigation, and remote sensing\u2014was where I thought it all really connects to modern society,\" she says.Although Datta-Barua admits it may be years before we can forecast space weather the way meteorologists track winter storms, the quest still shimmers on the horizon, brilliant as the northern lights.Seebany Datta-Barua's homepage:\"The Skeleton of Water,\" on Lagrangian coherent structures:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/brent-stephens", "content": "It's been said that some people resemble their pets and with that in mind, Brent Stephens, IIT assistant professor of architectural engineering, likens the structure of a building to its human inhabitants to help explain the diagnostic work that he does.

But, it doesn't have anything over IIT Main Campus. For in historic Carman Hall\u2014an apartment-residence for graduate students designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2014there exists a rather unassuming, largely empty, white-painted double-suite where no one lives. Yet graduate students can frequently be found there, running various pieces of mysterious-looking apparatuses with the aim of ultimately improving the quality of life for not only the residents of Carman Hall but for every person in the United States.Welcome to STUDIO E.\"I decided on the acronym STUDIO E, the Suite for Testing Urban Dwellings and their Indoor and Outdoor Environments,\" explains Brent Stephens, assistant professor of architectural engineering and director of IIT's[see the spring 2015article \"\"]. Inspired by a test house Stephens utilized as a doctoral student at the University of Texas at Austin, the studio serves as a \"living lab\" for developing methods to improve the air quality and energy impacts of the indoor environment. Stephens along with his team of five graduate students and several undergraduates are conducting various modeling and hands-on projects funded by government and industry organizations, including the.Also on the team is post-doctoral researcher Stephanie Kunkel (M.S BIOL '11, Ph.D. '14), who received a two-year $120,000 fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to work on a project that integrates microbiology with aerosol science and building science. With the help of a compressed-air cough simulator the team built that expels innocuous viruses, bacteria, and fungi in place of human pathogens, Kunkel is investigating the fate, transport, and control of airborne germs in the indoor environment of STUDIO E.\"With influenza, for example, there is still on ongoing debate about whether the virus is transmitted predominantly through touching surfaces or through the air. If surface transmission is dominant, then washing your hands or using hand sanitizer is obviously very important,\" says Stephens. \"But some models and measurements show that the virus may also be transmitted long distances through the air. Short of wearing a mask or a respirator\u2014if you are sick, the best option would simply be to stay home. We've all sat next to that person on the train who is a vector.\"Parham Azimi, one of Stephens's doctoral students, has been working on a related project in STUDIO E, namely, aprobability model of influenza transmission in an office environment. (Markov chain behavior modeling, useful in a number of fields from biology to finance, is a singular random process where what happens in the next level depends only upon the current level.) Stephens says that an infected individual who is coughing is surrounded by a \"hot zone\" of expelled viruses with the vast majority of them landing within a radius of less than a meter; smaller particles escape and remain airborne.\"Parham has determined mathematically that if someone spends 30 minutes in the hot zone, that person will have a much higher incidence of contracting the virus; if it's less than a half hour, the balance likely shifts to the airborne route,\" says Stephens. \"The person could still get infected but is at a lower risk.\"With winter on the wane and longer days ahead, concerns about the flu bug are being replaced with that of ozone, an inhaled pollutant that forms via chemical reactions that occur in the presence of sunlight. Stephens's team has been conducting ozone research in STUDIO E since its inception and is now refining a test method to determine the ability of the building shell to buffer against ozone infiltration indoors.\"We've made the first measurements of how ozone infiltrates into a multi-family building that we're aware of,\" says Stephens, who notes that for more susceptible populations, ozone is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. \"In STUDIO E, about 50 percent, on average, reacts away at the building shell and 50 percent enters indoors, which then reacts with surfaces.\"As an adjunct to the STUDIO E ozone project, the team is also measuring how outdoor particulate matter infiltrates indoors through an EPA grant [see the spring 2015article \"\"]."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/chapel-all", "content": "On the northeast side of IIT Main Campus, blocks away from the ornate red brick and arched fa\u00e7ade of Machinery Hall, is a more modest, single-story buildingthe Robert F. Carr Memorial Chapel of Saint Savior. Unassuming as it may appear, the structure is significant for two primary reasons.\"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe scholars and architectural historians understand that Carr Chapel is Mies' only ecclesiastical building and therefore of extreme interest because of his treatment of the religious nature of the building,\" explains Ted Haffner, chair of the Mies van der Rohe Society. \"Historian Kevin Harrington has related it to a Greek temple, while the building is known to IIT students on campus as the 'God Box.' Carr Chapel's simple, direct style of architecture makes it endlessly approachable yet decidedly spiritual.\"According to the Mies Society website, the idea for Carr Chapel was proposed in the late 1940s by then Bishop Wallace E. Conkling of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago. The gap between science and religion seemed wider than ever in the years following World War II; Conkling thought that a chapel within the technology-oriented environment of IIT could be the \"great educational project of the atomic age.\" University administrators, however, mandated that the chapel be open to students of all religious and spiritual beliefs.\"The importance of the building also lies in its connection to the student body,\" Haffner notes. \"The universal nature of the building makes it equally appealing to students of all faiths as well as student organizations and other groups. To my knowledge, it is one of the most difficult spaces on campus for which to schedule an event due to its popularity.\"The Mies Society raised $1 million for a Carr Chapel restoration project that began in 2008 and included improvements to the roof, the terrazzo floor, and the exterior blonde brickwork. A renovation to make an ADA-compliant restroom will be completed in spring 2015. Many of the project's donors came back to Carr this year on October 1 for a re-dedication of the chapel hosted by the Mies Society.\"This isn't a side of IIT's story that most people typically think about nor is it the type of story generally told about Mies,\" says Lynne Meyer, director of IIT's Office of Spiritual Life and Service Learning. \"But it's an important story, especially as we as a campus are doing more interfaith work and gaining national attention for it.\" Meyer, who served as an invited panelist at the Fourth Annual President's Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge National Gathering held September 22\u201323 in Washington, D.C., hopes to continue the story of Carr Chapel as IIT prepares for its 125th anniversary. To do that Meyer says she needs the assistance of individuals who know the chapel intimately.\"We are relying on our alumni to tell their stories of Carr Chapel,\" says Meyer, who officiated at a chapel wedding a few years ago. \"Their recollections and photos of weddings, baptisms, and other events will help us further understand the changing social, religious, and cultural landscape of IIT, the U.S., and the world from the perspective of our simple chapel.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/letters-editor", "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed your article about Rowine Hayes Brown Truitt onof the spring 2015 issue ofBeyond being an amazingly accomplished professional, she was blessed with charm and wit, hinted at by the twinkle in her eye in the photo.

Guided by terms stipulated in the will of benefactor Allen Cleveland Lewis, trustees tapped several prominent education visionaries to lead the institute, including William Rainey Harper and George Noble Carman, both on staff at the University of Chicago. By offering evening courses for the working class, Lewis Institute is considered to be the forerunner of adult education in the United States; its two-year Associate in Arts degree also makes it the first junior college. And Lewis's wishes to include a \"school for respectable females\" within the institute resulted in a bachelor's degree in domestic economy, with specialized coursework in the arts, sciences, and design to not only improve homemaking skills but also to form a foundation for a career in teaching.One such course, Household Management, determined by the Bureau of Education in Washington, D.C., to be the first of its kind in the country, was representative of the family-life education movement. Established at the turn of the twentieth century, this educational specialty arose in response to changing social conditions across the U.S. One of the movement's leaders, Lemo Dennis Rockwood, taught courses in child development and the economic problems of the family at Lewis, and supervised a Household-Management practice house\u2014complete with an infant from the Chicago Foundlings' Home, the first infant rescue institution in the Midwest. \"Baby George\" was loaned to the practice house for one year, during which groups of two to three young women took turns living in the house and learning how to care for a baby, maintain a home, and thrive as students.Dennis Rockwood and her students apparently excelled as practice-house foster mothers, according to an account written by Lewis Institute Professor Grace Gordon Hood in the 1926 Lewis yearbook: \"Under their care George has improved both physically and mentally, and has become the best-loved person in the department of home economics.\" After George, archival records indicate that there were Baby Lucille, Baby Billy, Baby Rosita, and Baby Bertram to round out the historic practice-house program. In 1959 IIT announced that the home economics program would be discontinued after its current students had completed their course of study.More than a century after its founding, Lewis College of Human Sciences continues to provide programs in emerging areas that reflect culture and society.

It is an apt birthdate for Evens, who would go on to make seminal contributions in computer science and to mentor more than 100 doctoral students since joining the Illinois Tech faculty. While her work in natural language processing and intelligent tutoring systems is considered significant, she perhaps is equally recognized for the role she played in the lives of her students, many whom have gone on to become notable faculty members, finance leaders, chief technology officers, and even university presidents.\"Martha is very well known as someone who put her heart into being there to help students; she's very much loved,\" says Eunice Santos, Ron Hochsprung Endowed Chair, chair of the Department of Computer Science, and professor of computer science at Illinois Tech. \"She's also an incredibly humble person,\" Santos adds. \"You'll learn more about what Martha's done from everybody else than you will from her.\"In a phone conversation from the Evanston, Illinois, home she shares with her husband, Len, Evens recalls that languages and computers filled her life from an early age. The daughter of an attorney and an architect, both educated at Harvard University, Evens was proficient in French and Latin by the time she enrolled at Bryn Mawr College, where she learned German and Greek, and graduated with a mathematics major and a Greek minor. She completed a year in Paris as a Fulbright Scholar and shortly before she graduated with a master's in mathematics from Harvard, her husband-to-be told her about an opening for a mathematician at theworking for artificial intelligence pioneer. She worked on the first spelling correction program at Lincoln Lab for two summers before undertaking a series of moves as her husband accepted faculty positions at the University of Chicago and the University of California, Berkeley, before accepting a permanent position at Northwestern University.\"My husband is a mathematician. But he knows a lot about computer science, partly because when I was getting my Ph.D. in computer science, if I knew something, he had to know more,\" says Evens, with a laugh. At Berkeley she collaborated with a group of linguists and wrote a program to parse sentences in Mandarin Chinese. In 1975 her turn to become a faculty member arrived as she began teaching at Illinois Tech one week after defending her doctoral thesis at Northwestern University.At Illinois Tech Evens did her most influential work, exploring how computers process and understand human language. In 1984 she was president of the Association for Computational Linguistics, an organization of people across the globe interested in natural language processing. She had a pivotal role in developing IITLEX, a lexical database useful in supporting various computer programs and individuals of varying linguistic backgrounds. When her student Ibrahim Al-Kharashi told her that his homeland of Saudi Arabia needed information-retrieval experts, she worked with him to form the Arabic Language Processing Laboratory at IIT, which was active in the 1990s. Evens also received funding for 12 years from the United States Office of Naval Research to build, an intelligent tutoring system using natural language dialogue. The program, created for Rush Medical College cardiovascular physiology students, went through several iterations beginning in 1988 before funding for it ended in 2006.At 82, she is now an emerita professor and continues to referee journal papers on natural language processing. Evens will be recognized later this year with the inaugural Martha W. Evens Endowed Lecture.\"My colleagues and the IIT staff have been tremendously supportive and my students have been wonderful,\" she says. \"I was very lucky to have been offered a job at IIT.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/iit-armour-college-engineering", "content": "Ask Veronica Torres (BME 4th year) to describe two highlights of her summer vacation, and chances are she will tell you about completing brain surgery on mice and observing cells glow when excited by high-energy light.

While there are many facets to this, I responded in terms of the role modeling, compelling curricula, and creative problem solving that take place here.Out of the 21 schools in the Association of Independent Technological Universities, Illinois Tech is the only one with a provost, dean of engineering, and head of computer science who are women. Role modeling is a principal vehicle for demonstrating diversity; it complements important attributes of Illinois Tech\u2014that we are an institution that values different ideas and multiple ways of being in the world.Illinois Tech's long history as a progressive higher-education institution continues today with the appointment of numerous women leaders across the university who are at the apex of their fields. Each of them is also building the leading edge of disciplinary pedagogical innovation and practice. Prominent members of this academic STEM community include:Many senior-level women leaders are working to ensure that our students derive the very most from their academic experience. These include renowned faculty, chairs, associate deans and directors, and leadership staff. Sharon Bostick, our dean of libraries, is most proud of the library's incredibly high rankings in student satisfaction surveys. Through her own research she has developed the Library Anxiety Scale, a statistically valid instrument demonstrating the most significant factor in lowering anxiety is human interaction. This finding has informed staffing strategy.All of our academic leaders give as much weight to the successes of their students, faculty, and units as they do to their own personal trajectories. Given that as a framework, our academic leaders have exemplary relationships with outstanding senior administrators. Katie Stetz, vice provost for student affairs and dean of students, is a respected academic team member. Faculty call upon her office for advice about students and make referrals to her departments at an increasing rate every year. Collaboration with the Office of Academic Affairs has been key.Under Betsy Hughes, vice president for institutional advancement, more than $400 million in philanthropic funding has been raised. This is critical in supporting the mission of Illinois Tech. Vice President for Finance and Administration Pat Laughlin has built a powerful and sustainable base to strengthen the university's finances. And alumni such as(CS '84) and(CHEM '77) inspire our students to create new STEM traditions even after they leave Illinois Tech.The goal across all of our fields is to build a strong environment for success.

I find it fascinating and appalling in equal measure, and it raises a lot of questions for me.I have a sports car that I love to drive. I love to drive, period. I find it fun and refreshing, and I have no intention of giving it up. What does this integrated network of self-driving cars mean for people like me? Do I throw my little convertible into a landfill and buy some ugly electronic box? Will I be banned from driving entirely unless I switch? Will I be forced to spend money I don't have on a \"kit\" to convert my car so it obeys orders from some electronic brain buried under the street? Will there be a whole other highway system for Luddites like me?Technology is rapidly disengaging us from our own lives, and this is another step down the wrong road. There's an app for almost everything now, with more coming into being every day\u2014from an app that does our shopping to an app that programs our televisions\u2014not to mention all the texting, tweeting, tumbling, and other electronic anarchy that is destroying social interaction and leaving humans with no idea how to deal with one another in real life.Thanks, but no thanks. I'll drive myself, if you don't mind.My mechanical drafting course was held on one of the upper floors. The windows were open to get some cooling air into the space.\u00a0Every time the coal-burning Broadway Limited, New York Central, or Pennsylvania Railroad trains went by, smoke and dust coated every drafting board, so it was impossible to grade on cleanliness. This problem got corrected before I graduated, so we all cheered the General Motors EMD [E]7 diesel-electric locomotives when they went by!One hot day I was teaching an engineering drawing laboratory on the fifth floor of Main Building. There was no air conditioning available and we had all the large windows on the west wall open for a slight breeze. I was walking around the room and along an aisle next to the windows. A student had placed a completed drawing on the windowsill and was about to begin a new drawing. A breeze blew his finished drawing out the window, and as the student and I watched, it slowly wafted downward to the New York Central tracks. A train of open coal cars was heading east toward New York City and the drawing fell into one of the cars. The student was upset. I told him I would give him the benefit of a doubt and award him an \"A\" for this part of the assignment.All engineers had to take mechanical drawing. Classes were held in Main. It was very important to keep your drawing clean; however, when a train went by,\u00a0dust shook down from the ceiling. So much for a clean drawing!One of my few extracurricular activities was an HO model railroad club that had a home in what, effectively, was the attic of Old Main.\u00a0The elevator was a very long, horizontal cylinder that raised us slowly\u2014and sometimes not at all\u2014to that floor. We built both a portable layout that we could demonstrate at meetings and also an in-place extensive layout.\u00a0We could also open a window and look down and watch the White Sox play in [the former] Comiskey Park. Binoculars helped. As I readand have experienced 67 years since graduation, the changes in all of engineering are truly amazing. I have often wondered, what are we going to do for the next years?I was taking a mechanical drafting class in the summer of 1955. The class was held on the third floor of Main on the side facing the Rock Island rail track. Because of the summer heat and no air conditioning, the windows\u00a0were kept wide open. A problem arose every time a steam locomotive went by just 30 feet away\u2014its\u00a0belching exhaust would flood the room. That meant you had to keep your in-process drawing all covered up except for the space on which\u00a0you were actually drawing. Neatness was part of the grade, so you learned to think defensively.I had a drafting class on the fifth floor. We could feel the floor shake every time a train went past. There were markings on the floor from a gymnasium that had been on that floor at one time. The elevator was available only to students with a physical need; sometimes other students would ride along. But it was so slow that you could climb the steps faster. The steps were well worn and had a concave surface.I still remember walking up those old stairs in the late '40s to attend my electrical engineering classes and also to work at my part-time job in the accounts payable department. I must have climbed those stairs several hundred times.\u00a0As I recall, Main was a splendid building, so I'm very pleased to hear that it will not be demolished but will be converted to apartments.In a heavy rain, the viaduct [on the north side of Main Building] would fill with water that was a combination of city sewer water and rainwater. One morning after a night of heavy rain, a colleague arrived for work, walked up the steps of Main Building, and pushed the elevator button to go up to our shared fourth-floor office. The elevator arrived, he got on, and the doors closed; however, the elevator went down to the basement, the doors opened, and it was immediately filled with waist-deep black water. He pushed the first-floor button, the doors closed, and the elevator started up, slowly losing the water. When the elevator got to the first floor, the doors opened, and my colleague left the building and went home. He didn't return until the next day.In approximately 1955 the U.S. Navy donated a very large radar unit to the IIT electrical engineering department. This was an old design using vacuum tubes and took up a large semitrailer pulled by a truck. The department decided to place this unit on top of the level roof on the south end of Main Building. They blocked off the street in front of Main Building and had a large crane next to the radar unit, planning to lift it up five stories and on the roof of the building.I was standing in the office of H. C. Spencer, [director] of the [technical] drawing department. (I was an instructor in this department from 1953\u201357). He was sitting at his desk with his back toward a large window that faced east, the same side of the building as the entrance. As we talked a huge black item flew downward in a split second while I was standing, facing this window. The crane had lifted the large trailer up slightly higher than the roof of the building, and a steel cable snapped before it moved the trailer over the top of the building. The trailer, loaded with thousands of vacuum tubes, dropped down and hit the street and the sidewalk with a big bang. It had completely destroyed the radar unit and eventually was taken to the dump. Fortunately, no person was walking along the sidewalk or the street when this happened.Freshman architecture drafting lab on fifth floor;\u00a0trying to keep drawings clean while Rock Island trains passed, emitting smoke and dirt from steam locomotives; sophomore construction lab with renowned professor Alfred Caldwell; finally moving to newly constructed Crown Hall; Crown Hall completion delayed due to a fire in the wood forms for the main floor, so we worked\u00a0elsewhere on drawings in the fall of our junior year, all long before the computer,\u00a0T-square, and triangle to the exacting standards established by [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe. Climbed those stairs many times.\u00a0Happy that Main Building will be preserved, hopefully historically true.Each time I have visited the campus on trips across the country I have stopped by Main Building, sort of a\u00a0Hajj to Mecca.\u00a0It was in that building,\u00a0top floor, where I was introduced to mechanical drawing (when we made lines with sharp pencils, believe it not).\u00a0This was one of my first classes at IIT, and it was important even then to succeed.\u00a0But as we older graduates know, grades in mechanical drawing were based on the quality (straight, even, un-smeared) lines. Each morning the commuter trains roared past; each class you would have to time your pencil on paper to gaps in the shaking structure.\u00a0It was a challenging and somewhat hopeless undertaking unless you had a midday schedule.I believe the experience influenced me later in life, when as project engineer\u00a0at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, I designed the fifth floor\u00a0expansion of Mahan Hall.\u00a0The expansion removed the mechanical drafting labs to a clerestory on the top floor and substituted a computer laboratory\u2014with nary a slide rule or protractor in sight.\u00a0Revenge! My last trip up the building was in 2012, but I still stopped by this year to get a glimpse of the first-floor [stained] glass majesty at the landing of the main stairs.I have had a picture of Old Main along with my Sigma Iota Epsilon (honorary management fraternity) certificate on the wall for more than 20 years. I recall one course in Old Main where I readand still recall the point of the book! As an old South Sider, I wish good luck to all involved with the MCM remodeling project.IIT MagazineIIT Magazine"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/letter-president", "content": "The summer season brings to mind a passage from the bookby the late university educator Ester Schaler Buchholz: \"Others inspire us, information feeds us, practice improves our performance, but we need quiet time to figure things out, to emerge with new discoveries, to unearth original answers.\" This period between our spring and fall semesters gives our faculty time to recharge and focus more intently on their projects.

The result is reduced toxicity compared to the currently available treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the potential for the highly effective cancer therapeutic method has been explored.One area of immunotherapy that offers promise is the application of conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system produces to identify and kill harmful pathogens by recognizing the unique molecular signature of that pathogen, called an antigen. A monoclonal antibody has been cloned from a parent cell and is expected to target and bind to the specific antigen expressed on cancer cancerous cells, thereby leading to death of the cancers.Hyun-Sun Chong, a professor of chemistry at Illinois Tech, is developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for targeted cancer therapy in her lab.\"The idea is to use a specific-tumor seeking antibody to load cytotoxic drugs or radiation to the targeted tumor site,\" she says. \"This selective targeting allows a therapeutic drug or radiation to be safely delivered to cancer cells, while minimizing damage to normal healthy cells.\"Chong's interdisciplinary research laboratory is currently focused on the development of anti-cancer drugs and utilization of radiation and antibody combinations in preclinical studies. The process starts by designing and producing drug candidates and then screening them against human cancer cell lines in her lab. Promising drugs can then be conjugated to a tumor-specific antibody for generation of ADCs for detailed preclinical studies. In collaboration with other researchers in medical schools, the best antibody-drug conjugates will be investigated for their effectiveness in removing tumors in animal models.She says that this therapeutic approach has improved the efficacy and safety of traditional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy and has been utilized for development of personalized cancer drugs, particularly in the area of ADC pharmaceuticals and radioimmunotherapy (RIT), in which the conjugated antibody is attached to a radioactive isotope designed to kill cancer cells.\"The RIT technology is a safer and more potent way to deliver radiation to cancer cells but has been limitedly applied to the clinic,\" Chong says. \"To develop clinically viable RIT drugs, it is essential to use optimal chelation chemistry to sequester a therapeutic radioactive metal rapidly and tightly. A radioactive metal has a limited half-life, ranging from hours to days, and efficient generation of RIT drugs is critical. A premature release of a radioactive metal from less stable RIT drugs will lead to a long-term toxicity, including bone marrow toxicity. We design and study chelation chemistry by controlling a combination of parameters for the generation of stable RIT drugs with high in vivo stability and blood clearance.\"Chong is also investigating the application of chelation chemistry to generate antibody conjugates for detecting cancers using positron emission topography (PET) imaging technology. In this technique, a radioactive imaging probe bound to an optimal chelate is attached to an antibody. The radiolabeled antibody conjugate targeting a specific tumor site is injected into the live animals. The radiolabeled antibody conjugates are localized to cancerous cells present in the patient that can be detected and imaged by the PET scan. The highly sensitive PET can detect cancer that other imaging techniques might miss and also monitor the effectiveness of ongoing treatments.Since 2004 Chong's research on antibody-targeted cancer therapy and imaging has been continuously supported by more than $2 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. Her work has thus far led to two United States patents being issued and an additional two U.S. patent applications. Additionally, Chong's lab is discussing transfer of ADC/RIT technology for clinical applications to realize safe and potent targeted cancer therapy and imaging.is the study of how molecules bind to one another in a chelate complex. The word chelate comes from the Greek, meaning \"claw,\" and refers to the strength of the bond.

As a statistician, she develops efficient data-collection and data-analysis methodologies and theories to create statistical models for complicated engineering and scientific systems.Government agencies and industry partners alike have funded Kang's research in this area since 2011. She is currently one of three principal investigators on a $117,888 grant from the National Science Foundation to study and improve four different systems\u2014organ transplantation, semiconductor wafer production, thermal spray coating, and crystal growth processes. These systems are defined as quantitative-qualitative (Q-Q) systems, since the data collected are of both types. For instance, the quality of a product can be categorized to be \"good\" or \"bad,\" while many other quantitative measurements are also collected to characterize the product's quality.\"We can control, optimize, and monitor such systems,\" says Kang. \"To achieve that we collect data from the system and develop a surrogate statistical model for our analysis schemes.\"The first benefit of this model is that it allows her to determine how her team will collect data in order to solve a problem. \"The second,\" she says, \"is that when we collect the data, it is very rigorous and has less noise.\"When data is collected in a way that minimizes noise (variations such as environmental fluctuations and process variability), the resulting model is more precise. \"A computer simulation is deterministic, so every time you choose a data setup or setting for operational parameters, you will always get the same response,\" she says.When the project concludes later this year, Kang anticipates that the team will have developed a best practices framework for the modeling and quality improvement of Q-Q systems. As associate director of Illinois Tech's, she also notes that case studies from the project will be useful as training aids for students.Another area of Kang's research is on uncertainty quantification, the science of quantifying and examining uncertainty in computational simulation systems. Kang develops statistical surrogate models from the computer simulations she and her collaborators construct. Such surrogate models allow investigators to quickly understand a system's strengths and weaknesses, generate more simulation results with cheaper costs, and achieve more efficient optimization of the system.Looking beyond the NSF grant, Kang would like to apply her methodologies and theories honed in biomedicine and engineering to big-data sets, which is an area that presents new challenges. While in theory larger sets of data may provide a more accurate model of data, Kang notes that \"data sets can be inherently biased. If you are extracting information from very big data sets, you have to make sure your sampling is reasonable and meaningful. Is it sufficient to build an accurate model? This is crucial in this age of big data.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2016/creating-climate-connections", "content": "In the spring, air pollution in Seoul, Korea, often exceeds the World Health Organization's recommended levels\u2014a problem that is regularly attributed to pollution that originates in China and blows across international boundaries. Matthew Shapiro, an associate professor of political science at Illinois Tech's Lewis College of Human Sciences and research affiliate at Argonne National Laboratory's Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), doesn't think the phenomenon is explained quite so easily.Shapiro's research is primarily focused on science and technology policies and environmental politics in the Northeast Asia region. \"These dovetail given that if you have science and technology policy that focuses on green research and development you get outcomes that are desirable,\" he says. \"I'm also studying the politics of those same issues, because they're very controversial. We're all aware of the divisive nature of climate-change science, especially in this country. What I am also doing is looking at the politicization of science and the way that it's portrayed in the media and online.\"His study of environmental politics in Asia focuses on transboundary pollution and pollution havens. Transboundary pollution describes pollution produced in one country that crosses borders into a neighboring country, for example, yellow dust originating in the deserts of Mongolia and northern China that's carried south and east by prevailing winds throughout Asia, and even as far as the West Coast of the United States. Pollution havens are countries with lax environmental laws that attract foreign manufacturing but produce a higher proportion of pollution than their regional neighbors as a result.\"China is everyone's manufacturing center these days. So if the pollution is blowing out of China, it can't strictly be Chinese firms,\" says Shapiro. \"There has to be some relation to Korea, Japan, and the United States. These countries represent about half of all foreign direct investment in China.\"\"That problem is also politicized,\" he says. \"The previous president of Korea was really on board with green research and development but the current president is not. I'm researching the international political economy of the region to determine how Korea is contributing to its own pollution by exporting its manufacturing to China.\"Shapiro was named a 2015\u201316 U.S.-Korea NextGen Scholar for the Center for Strategic and International Studies and received an Asiatic Research Institute Research Fellowship from Korea University in 2014. \u00a0He recently received an EHWA (Ewha Womans University)-Korean American Communication Association Research Award for his work on yellow dust pollution in Korea.At JCESR, he is involved in next-generation battery-storage research.

David Mogul, professor of biomedical engineering, is attempting to understand what happens to that network when a seizure occurs.Mogul's background in electrical engineering led him to realize studying the brain using network theory could hold the key to understanding epilepsy. During a seizure, dramatic changes in the brain's structural and functional networks occur, and Mogul thinks that understanding epilepsy as a network disorder could hold the key to successfully treating it.More than 1 percent of the world's population has some form of, and after stroke it is the neurological disease that results in the second-highest number of fatalities, says Mogul. The currently available treatments include medications and surgical removal, or ablation, of the affected part of the brain, but both can carry debilitating side effects. About a third of patients aren't helped by either.Mogul, an Illinois Tech faculty member since 2002, believes that(DBS) could hold promise. DBS uses electrodes implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to brain nuclei to block or inhibit neuronal activity, although the exact mechanism by which it works is still unclear. It has been successfully used to treat Parkinson's disease and has been tried experimentally for the treatment of epilepsy in both animals and humans, but results have been unpredictable, erratic, and largely disappointing, he says.\"If you want to optimize stimulation, you have to understand the dynamics of the brain as it goes into and out of seizures,\" says Mogul, who received a five-year, $1.28 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February 2016 to continue pursuing this research. He studies these dynamics in rats that undergo chronic repetitive seizures (in other words, epilepsy) by recording and analyzing brain function to tease apart what the brain experiences as a seizure evolves.\"We saw certain characteristic electrical behaviors in brains at the onset of a seizure and as it naturally terminates,\" he explains. \"We initially focused our efforts on trying to see if once a seizure initiates, we could terminate it with electrical stimulation.\"Mogul and his colleagues discovered that individual rats had unique neurological dynamics both during seizures and as the seizures naturally subsided. By using DBS that was matched to the observed natural electrical activity of an individual rat's brain, the researchers could artificially terminate seizures significantly\u00a0more rapidly and effectively than could be accomplished with currently employed DBS protocols that typically do not reflect actual seizure dynamics. He believes his team has found a mechanism that can, in part, help to guide optimization of stimulation, and that such treatment may be translatable to personalized medicine for epilepsy patients that is superior to what is now available.Ain the January 2016 issue ofdescribing this research, coauthored by Mogul and Tiwalade Sobayo, a doctoral candidate (and now fellow) in biomedical engineering at Illinois Tech, was recently selected to receive the 2017Prize for the Best Basic Science Paper of 2016. Mogul's team is also partnering with NIH to analyze patient data from its International Epilepsy Electrophysiology Database at the University of Pennsylvania.

Illinois Tech Assistant Professor of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering Carrie Hall is currently at the cutting edge of that search for new ways to make diesel engines cleaner and more efficient using dual-fuel technology.Hall, the recipient of a $500,000 Faculty Early Career Development () Award from the National Science Foundation, is applying innovations from studies of single-cylinder engines that useto multi-cylinder engines like those found in commercial trucks.like the Volvo V90 Bi-Fuel use a blend of two fuels, such as natural gas and gasoline. Each fuel is optimally efficient under different conditions, and using both allows for a more efficient engine overall. The goal is to develop automotive engines that can use an ideal blend of fuels that run more cleanly and provide the most efficient power output for the load demands on the engine.\"In passenger cars it's simpler to just go to electric or hybrid vehicles,\" says Hall. \"But for larger Class A trucks, we can't have an electric option. They're going to have to burn diesel fuel or something like it for the foreseeable future. These technologies could make them potentially more efficient.\"Hall's current research is focused on understanding the fundamental dynamics of how a multi-cylinder, dual-fuel engine operates under various conditions. The next stage, she says, is understanding how to control such a complex, nonlinear system. \"That becomes a very challenging mathematical problem, so lessons that we learn certainly have applications that we can take into other things,\" she says. \"We're dealing with something that's producing power from two sources, which is the same kind of thing that you're doing on a hybrid vehicle, so a lot of other applications will have similar kinds of constraints and issues.\"Hall became interested in engine technology because she wanted to tackle what she considers to be one of today's biggest problems: how to efficiently produce energy with minimal environmental ramifications. She was drawn to automotive engineering because of the challenges involved in producing energy in a moving object. \"You can produce energy in a stationary thing that's just sitting there,\" she says, \"or you can produce it in something that's moving around, and something that's moving around is a lot more fun.\"Unlike a standard research grant, the CAREER proposal has an educational aspect. Carrie Hall is using it to approach the challenge of sparking younger students' interest in STEM subjects. Beginning with first- and second-graders, Hall is working with a curriculum developer and a grammar school in Waukegan to integrate engineering activities as early as possible. They've used tuning forks and cup-and-string phones made of different materials to introduce first-graders to the engineering process. \"A lot of times if we try to get girls into mechanical engineering programs, the norm is that you go to a high school,\" says Hall. At that point, they've often already decided on other subjects.Hall says that by also focusing on the societal impacts of engineering, educators can make the field more attractive to young women in particular. \"A lot of times girls and women like to be doing something that helps people or that's going to make a difference,\" she says. \"What I was interested in was this energy problem. I was intrigued by that, and it led me to mechanical engineering. I think that for a lot of girls it can be that way. But I also think there's a role in coming into the classroom a lot earlier and getting people a lot more acquainted with what the engineering process actually looks like.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2018/brilliant-beacons-research-horizon", "content": "The future of tailored cancer drug therapy lies within the lima bean-shaped image on a computer screen in Illinois Tech's.

The treatment for metastatic disease is very aggressive; you would not want to give that treatment to somebody who did not need it. Physicians need some way of identifying who should be given the aggressive treatment,\" says Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, developer of the ADEPT (Agent-Dependent Early Photon Tomography System) Cancer Imager. He notes that current studies indicate that patients who have microscopic levels of metastatic disease and who would benefit from a more aggressive therapy are being missed 30 to 60 percent of the time. \"Patients are then coming back later with a more advanced disease than before they started cancer therapy.

These nodes are then injected with biologically active fluorescent substances (fluorophores, which display as red and green) that chemically interact with the tissue, seeking out proteins that are over-expressed by breast cancer. The node is then suspended in the imager and photons, or light particles, pass through the tissue, resulting in a cross-sectional image displaying a \"map\" of where the red and green dyes, also known as paired agents, have traveled. The tissue specimen can be rotated 360 degrees in the ADEPT chamber so that a 3-D reconstruction can be produced. A larger amount of the protein-seeking dye indicates the presence of cancer while an equivalent proportion of dye distribution would indicate no presence of cancer.\"We've become leading experts in paired-agent imaging, which allows for quantitative mapping of the cancer molecules,\" says Tichauer, adding that in a clinical setting, the images would reveal the exact area where cancer cells lie within minutes, thereby allowing medical experts to accurately process the tissue specimen and decide upon the course of treatment.Tichauer came up with the idea for two-color imaging for cancer detection while he was a postdoc at Dartmouth College, exploring the kinetics of imaging agents in tissue and applying mathematical models to extract quantitative information. At Illinois Tech he formed the ADEPT team with co-principal investigators(M.S. EE '99, Ph.D. '02), a systems development expert and associate professor of biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and, a biologist with IIT Research Institute. In 2016 the ADEPT Cancer Imager was selected over two other faculty teams to advance to the second phase of Illinois Tech'sI. Trustee(M.S. IE '68) and his wife, Teresa, on behalf of the Nayar Family Foundation, established a $1 million gift to fund the Nayar Prize I (and later, Nayar Prize II) to challenge university faculty, staff, and students to develop breakthrough, innovative projects that will, within three years, produce meaningful results with a societal impact. Tichauer was also funded through a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development () Award in 2017 to further refine the imager. The researchers credit their cadre of undergraduate and graduate students with making important contributions to the project. Doctoral student Cynthia Li (BME Ph.D. student) contributed to the development of the pig lymph node procedure. Lagnojita Sinha (BME Ph.D. student), Tichauer's student since 2013, helped build the imager.\"Although my knowledge of optics was limited in the beginning, the lab was a very supportive and encouraging environment where all ideas were equally welcomed, as we all were experimenting and learning at the same time,\" says Sinha, who has trained Veronica Torres (BME Ph.D. student) to take her place on the team. \"It was enlightening to build a system from scratch that is now able to perform imaging at a high resolution and has the potential to do groundbreaking research in the future.\"Brankov provides a sobering statistic that underscores the researchers' ultimate goal behind the creation of the ADEPT Cancer Imager.\"From 90 to 95 percent of [cancer] drugs fail at the clinical stage. They have very good results in animal models and in some preliminary phase 1 stages, but when they go into phase 2 and phase 3, they fail,\" says Brankov. \"The cost of the effective drug is now high because only 5 percent of the investment actually pans out to be something. One of the theories on the heterogeneity of the tumor is that there are various different cancer cells that are undetected or not differentiated. The imager would shorten the time to develop the effective drug and could be a huge savings not only to pharmaceutical companies, but also to NIH [National Institutes of Health], which is funding most of the research.\"The cyan-colored image is the ADEPT image of the targeted imaging agent distribution (lots of nonspecific retention)The magenta-colored image is the ADEPT image of the control imaging agent (to account for the nonspecific retention)The lymph cartoon is overlaid with the ratio of the cyan and magenta images, highlighting the locations of the three microscopic cancer lesions.

Yet not so long ago he was a small town Ohio boy struggling to find a path to college.\"I chose Illinois Tech because when I looked at the landscape of engineering schools that were out there, not only was Illinois Tech one of the best, but, frankly, it was one within my grasp,\" explains Althoff. \"I didn't have a lot of means to go to college.\"Althoff received a scholarship and now he is paying that gift forward. It is an act of generosity Acosta hopes to imitate.\"I look at my scholarship as a loan that I expect to pay back with interest to the school \u2026 in the form of donations toward scholarships.\"To learn more about scholarships at Illinois Tech, visit."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/media/illinois-tech-125-years-165-seconds", "content": "Listen to Associate Professor Matthew Spenko's take on this in an IIT Magazine Audio Extra.Remember.

While she admits that the computer is an indispensable tool, Solomon also says that a perhaps more dated object holds timeless appeal for her.\"I love going to a library and just looking at the books,\" she told a group of IIT students who had the opportunity to meet with her before she delivered the Darsh T. Wasan Lecture in October.\"One of the things I started doing early in my career, and still do to some extent, is when I become interested in a particular scientific problem, I go to the library and trace it back to find out who was the first person who actually thought about this issue. I find it difficult just working on the Internet to see what I call the flow of the river of knowledge. To me, being a scientist is all about contributing to that flow, putting a couple of drops into the river. I want to understand the river, and in order to do that, I really want to see the original books.\"Solomon's immersion into her chosen career took place at IIT's Paul V. Galvin Library. Her interest in quantitative chemistry led her to do a senior project with the late IIT Professor David Gutman, an expert in reaction kinetics. His work on the rate of a chemical reaction that was significant to the atmosphere of Jupiter inspired her to dig through Galvin's books and journals to further research the chemistry of planetary atmospherics. This research further fueled a passion Solomon had begun to develop earlier in her life.\"I wanted to go after things that were important to our planet,\" she says. \"It's a feeling that if I can contribute in some way, then I should try.\"After graduating from IIT and earning her doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, where she specialized in atmospheric chemistry, Solomon started working for the NOAA. She became adept at computer modeling, and using that technique she surmised that a unique chemical reaction was occurring on the surfaces of clouds in the lower Antarctic stratosphere, contributing to the destruction of the protective ozone layer in that part of the world. In 1986, she was tapped to lead a team to the McMurdo Station to get direct measurements to test all the possibilities. Light measurements she and her team took onsite supported her hypothesis that chlorofluorocarbons, organic compounds used at that time in personal care products and coolant systems, were the main driver of the reaction.The following year, the Montreal Protocol was established, with representatives from 24 nations signing the treaty to limit the production of CFCs; by September 2009, all member countries of the United Nations ratified the original protocol.During the more than three decades that she has been with the NOAA, Solomon has expanded her research to include climate change, and is considered one of the world's leading experts in the field. She was named co-chair of Working Group One of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and helped to compile a landmark report on global warming. In 2007, the IPCC and former Vice President Al Gore shared in the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. In the Wasan Lecture, \"A Tale for Our Times: Something for Everyone About Climate Change and the Reasons for Climate Gridlock,\" Solomon noted that the climate change issue differs from the CFC issue on several levels. While it was easy for everyone to understand that skin cancer cases would likely rise if the protective ozone layer continued to be eroded, it may be a lot more difficult to imagine the varying predicted effects of global warming\u2014from increased heavy rainfall in the Midwestern United States to 10-20 percent drier conditions in Mediterranean countries\u2014and their repercussions.The amount of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide that Americans alone emit is now approximately 25 tons per person per year. \"On average, the 5.5 billion people in the developing world emit about five times less carbon dioxide per person than the 1 billion people in the developed world,\" she says, adding that the problem is not so much a function of the number of people as much as it is that lifestyles have become increasingly prosperous.While the ozone layer is expected to recover by the middle of the twenty-first century, at today's emission rates 20 percent of the carbon dioxide added by people today will still be circulating in the Earth's atmosphere 1,000 years from now. Trees, the soil, and the upper levels of the oceans\u2014normal carbon dioxide sinks\u2014become saturated with the gas so that only the deep ocean remains as a long-term reservoir, but the rate of uptake there is very slow. According to Solomon, the only way to increase that rate is by altering the carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium of the sea water, which takes many thousands of years.She is hopeful that considerations being taken now in the development of future infrastructure and alternative energy forms, along with public discussion on climate change issues, will lead to the best direction for society. Solomon is adamant, however, that policymaking decisions be left to elected leaders.\"Our job as scientists is simply to state the science as we know it and to avoid political advocacy,\" she says.A recipient of the President's National Medal of Science in 1999 for her ozone discoveries, Solomon continues to conduct ongoing investigations of the ozone hole, looking at recent changes that are further influencing the air circulation and meteorology of Antarctica. She is also performing computer modeling on the persistence of climate change, investigating such topics as how long it would take for the climate to return to the state it was before various chemicals began to be regularly emitted into the atmosphere by people.It is a way for her to build upon the work of those researchers who came before her and to add to the river of knowledge.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:Ozone Hole:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/node/2776/", "content": "If you're looking for a way to get more involved with your alma mater this year, look no further!

Now the Ron Hochsprung Endowed Chair, chair of the Department of Computer Science, and professor of computer science at Illinois Tech, Santos, the daughter of an electrical engineer and a mathematics professor, recognized her innate capacity for STEM disciplines early in life. She graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science and math before earning her doctoral degree in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.Santos served on the faculties of Lehigh University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and was selected to be a senior research fellow with the United States Department of Defense. She studied and helped to understand the behavior of certain groups implicated in global health and security, was a member of several senior technical advisory boards, and was also named to the. Before coming to Illinois Tech, she served as professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso, which included her role as director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Center for Border Security and Immigration.\"I was attracted to Illinois Tech computer science for its size and its strong history, leadership, and reputation,\" she says. \"We have a great history of research and innovation in the department. We have more than 1,200 students who are next-generation leaders. Another great strength is our alumni and their leadership in the tech ecosystem\u2014we are 5,000-strong just in Chicago. We are already seeding the tech ecosystem with our research and people. We want to build on that history, enabling even broader and deeper influence.\"Plans include increasing research in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data science, as well as continuing to strengthen pipeline projects to bring more diversity and first-generation college students into computing, such as the department's well-established computer discovery camp for middle-school girls. The department also will facilitate the role of computer science to advance research and innovation in other disciplines.Illinois Tech Trustee Chris Gladwin, founder of the data-storage company Cleversafe, who donated $7.6 million to the university to further strengthen the computer science program, was on the committee that recruited Santos to Mies Campus.\"When I interviewed Eunice, I learned that many of the areas planned for future growth and research in computer science were areas where she was already an established expert,\" he says. \"When I reflect on my many conversations with her, I realize that she's right in practically everything she says.\"One of the areas in which Santos is considered an authority is computational modeling, the use of computers to simulate and explore the behavior of complex systems ranging from disease to cybersecurity.\"We are already seeding the tech ecosystem with our research and people.

Growing up in west suburban Wheaton, Ill., he knew about IIT as far back as the days he listened to Jack Brickhouse provide play-by-play coverage for the Chicago Cubs on WGN Radio. Although Hakes is now on IIT's side of the court, he shot hoops against the Scarlet Hawks at Keating Sports Center as a student at Trinity International University and in later years coached visiting soccer teams from North Park University and Moody Bible Institute that played against IIT.Hakes, however, has brought something more than professional abilities to IIT in his quest to help student-athletes succeed: a desire to help them become the very best people they can be after they leave the university.Less than a week after his official IIT start date of August 1, Hakes greets guests in an office largely devoid of d\u00e9cor save for a desk coaster with the characteristic blue and red logo of his beloved Cubbies. There is also a laminated and framed article fromhanging on the wall facing him entitled \"A Final Journey With Mom,\" a 500-word essay penned by Hakes and published in the magazine in 2007. It is a tender account of how he and his family came to scatter his mother's ashes in the waters bordering the coastal town in Maine where Hakes's parents spent their honeymoon in 1941.\"My father was sitting on the side steps of the student union at Wheaton College when this freshman girl walked by, and he turned to his buddy and said, 'That's the woman who I'm going to marry,'\" recalls Hakes, who said his dad had originally intended to spread his wife's ashes at Wheaton. \"She went into the hospital on their 62nd wedding anniversary. She had cancer and we thought that it was gone, but it came back.\"Hakes's late mother was a nurse and his father was vice president for academic affairs at Trinity, so compassion and higher education permeated the lives of family members. Little wonder that Hakes notes that even with NCAA Division III status in his sites, his aim as athletic director is not necessarily to turn out professional-level athletes.\"What we're trying to produce are graduates of good, solid academic programs who also have the added experience of being involved in a great competition, who have the ability to work with their teammates and understand authority, and who know how to provide authority in leadership roles,\" he explains.This was a goal he set at all four of the institutions where he served as athletic director\u2014Moody Bible Institute, King University, Gordon College, and Millikin University. Hakes says he is continually amazed by the number of friend requests he gets on Facebook from former student-athletes thanking him for a character development trait he successfully instilled in them.\"To me, that's a great affirmation that I've done something right along the way. I feel blessed to be a part of something that has positively impacted so many student-athletes,\" says Hakes. \"And I am grateful for the opportunity to take things to the next level at IIT.

IE '68) expanded his software consulting firm Unitech Systems from a staff of one man to many individuals, he adopted a nonconformist management philosophy. Inspired by the quality principles set forth by statistician W. Edwards Deming, Nayar chose collaboration as his company's cornerstone.\"What I found when I started and ran the company was that, by and large, the current system at the time did not encourage cooperation; it encouraged competition, especially within the organization and there are many horror stories of how that manifested itself,\" he says, from a conference room in University Technology Park on Illinois Tech's Mies Campus. \"It did not give me satisfaction building a company that I would want to last forever. Most companies that promoted competition from within, over time, seem to disappear.\"Unitech Systems, now known as Infogix, still exists today (it was sold in 2012 to a private equity investment firm) and its founder still believes in collaboration as exemplified by his $1 million gift to Illinois Tech to fund the Nayar Prize. The award supports university teams as they work to develop breakthrough, innovative projects that will produce meaningful results with a societal impact within a three-year period. On November 4, 2015, three teams of faculty researchers were presented with $100,000 each to jumpstart their efforts during the first year of the prize cycle. At the completion of this first year, only one team will advance to the next phase with $200,000 in additional funding. Upon the successful completion of benchmarks/performance metrics set by the team, members will receive the final $500,000 Nayar Prize.Each recipient team for the first round comprises collaborators from various colleges and disciplines:Kenneth Tichauer (Armour College of Engineering/Biomedical Engineering), Jovan Brankov (Armour College of Engineering/Electrical and Computer Engineering; Biomedical Engineering), and Rajendra Mehta (College of Science/Biology) are developing a new imaging system capable of spatially mapping the variable characteristics of cancers at the cellular level.Marshall Brown (College of Architecture), Lili Du (Armour College of Engineering/Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering), Laura Forlano (Institute of Design), Jack Guthman (planning attorney who formerly was with the College of Architecture), and Ron Henderson (College of Architecture) are exploring social scenarios, technical solutions, infrastructural prototypes, and model urban codes for the co-evolution of human and non-human transportation systems.Carly Kocurek (Lewis College of Human Sciences/Humanities), Jennifer Miller (Lewis College of Human Sciences/Psychology), Cynthia Hood (College of Science/Computer Science), and Matt Bauer (Lewis College of Human Sciences/Humanities) are designing a research-driven, high-impact interactive game for children ages 24\u201336 months that will help them to expand their vocabulary and be better prepared to succeed in school.The six-member prize jury was composed of Frances Bronet, Illinois Tech provost and senior vice president for academic affairs; Illinois Tech Life Trustee Martin \"Marty\" Cooper (EE '50, M.S.

Most intriguing was a project to develop a device for the blind that would restore vision by channeling electronic stimuli into the brain's visual cortex\u2014where, normally, neural impulses from the eyes are converted into the moving images called \"sight.\" Such a device could benefit as many as two million persons who are blind or suffer severe visual impairment.\"All of the neuroprosthesis projects that were being done at the NIH were interesting, but it was clear that a visual prosthesis that could be implanted in the brain to restore vision was the big trophy\u2014the Holy Grail of neural-prosthesis research,\" Troyk says.The year was 1983, and Troyk pledged to attend future meetings on neural-prosthesis research, immerse himself in the literature, and get acquainted with leaders in the field.\"I always had a fascination with marrying electronic technology and the human body. The possibilities stirred the imagination,\" says Troyk, now associate professor of biomedical engineering in.Troyk's imagination was put to a big test in 1996, when events moved IIT rapidly\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014from the sidelines into the vanguard of visual-prosthesis research. Early in the year, IIT was awarded a $1 million NIH contract to design and fabricate an implantable visual prosthetic device for the blind, based on electronic stimulation of the visual cortex. However, several months into the project, NIH officials announced plans to abandon the human research, citing as one of the reasons its inability to guarantee human volunteers lifelong maintenance of visual-prosthesis implants.Initially, the decision was a devastating blow for those whose careers had been devoted to advancing the research and who now felt the once unimaginable was within reach. In addition, IIT researchers had already made major progress under its NIH contract. Although NIH would honor the IIT contract, there were no plans to use the implantable device. \"It appeared that we now had a solution in search of a problem,\" Troyk thought.Soon, some NIH researchers began pitching the visual prosthesis project elsewhere, hoping that the NIH might continue funding under the auspices of a different organization. Troyk was dedicated to reviving the work, and quickly assembled a 20-member team of distinguished biological, behavioral and visual scientists from the, an international leader in psychophysical research and neurosurgery;, Pasadena, California, which pioneered the development and safety testing of electrode arrays used in intra-cortical visual prosthesis research; and, a Newton, Massachusetts-based leader in advanced electrode technology. In addition, Troyk enlisted two retired NIH scientists, including the neurosurgeon who performed the landmark brain implant of a visual prosthesis at NIH, as well as an NIH expert in electrode design.Under Troyk's leadership, the newly formed team began putting together an NIH proposal for restarting the project. Meanwhile, IIT tapped into private funding to support its development and testing of a visual prosthesis.In the near future, IIT researchers will test a prototype intra-cortical visual prosthesis. The system uses four 256-channel electric stimulators that would act as \"command central\"\u2014sitting on a patient's skull under the skin to produce the tiny currents needed to drive 1,024 miniature electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. Small in size (one-inch by one-inch by one-quarter-inch), the ceramic-encased stimulator module contains 40 separate microchips that control the 256 electrodes. The implant is powered and communicated with remotely, by a magnetic coil placed on the surface of the skin. No wires will cross the skin. The system's multi-channel capabilities offer unprecedented coverage of the visual cortex. (Implants of this size for other applications typically provided only eight to fifty channels, while heart pacemakers use only two to four channels.)The ultimate goal is to link the electric stimulator to a video camera mounted on a pair of glasses to act as the \"eye.\" Signals passing through the lens to the device would selectively stimulate different electrodes in the visual cortex to produce spots of light, called phosphenes. Researches expect that the resulting image \"seen\" in the mind will actually correspond to an object in the environment. But they're really not sure what patients will perceive. \"At first, they might only sense pinpoints of light, or crude 'Light-Bright' facsimiles of images in which there are only outlines of images,\" explains Troyk. \"But given the brain's ability to modify neural pathways and form new connections, patients might\u2014after months of training\u2014be able to integrate these points of light into nebulous forms, or even sharper images. In the worst case, they might only see the outline of a door. In the best case, they might see the Mona Lisa.\"Whether the mind will \"see\" doorframes or Renaissance portraits may well be determined in a privately-funded program that got under way last summer under Troyk's leadership. The new multi-institutional team faces an ambitious agenda that is expected, one day, to culminate in brain implants of the IIT-developed visual prosthesis in human volunteers.The effort will build on an extensive history\u2014a point that Troyk repeatedly insists on making. \"It just so happens that a series of circumstances have brought this work to the point where I inherited it,\" says Troyk. \"In one form or another, this project has been going on for more than 30 years. There's a traceable path back to many people who dedicated their careers to advancing pieces of this technology, including several who are now part of this team.\"Scientists knew as early as 1918 that touching electrodes to the visual cortex of conscious patients produced spots of light. By the 1940s, researchers had established the concept of artificial electrical stimulation of the visual cortex, and in the late 1960s, British scientist Giles Brindley produced breakthrough findings with a system for placing electrodes on the brain's surface. When specific areas of the brain were stimulated in blind volunteers, all reported \"seeing\" phosphenes that corresponded to where they would have appeared in space. However, experiments were discontinued because of the uncomfortably high currents required for stimulation on the surface of the brain.Encouraged by Brindley's findings, the NIH began working toward an intra-cortical visual prosthesis in the early 1970s. First, they abandoned the idea of brain-surface stimulation, theorizing that microelectrodes could be implanted in the visual cortex and safely stimulated using much less current. The NIH work led to the development of new electrodes\u2014finer than the could be safely implanted in animals to electrically stimulate, and passively record, electrical activity in the brain. The efforts produced significant advances in neurophysiology, with publication of hundreds of papers in which researchers attempted to develop an electronic interface to the brain.By 1995, NIH researchers decided they were ready to proceed to human testing of an intra-cortical visual prosthesis. Thirty-eight electrodes, connected to fine wires penetrating the scalp, were implanted in the brain of a 42-year-old woman. Although blinded by glaucoma 22 years earlier, using the electrical stimulation she was still able to sense phosphenes, and eventually became adept at perceiving those dots under a variety of stimulation patterns.As the work of the new IIT-led efforts gets under way, team members are confident that \"there's a solid foundation for what we're attempting to do, and a reasonable expectation from an engineering standpoint that it's technologically feasible,\" Troyk said.Topping the research agenda are testing and perfecting the IIT-developed hardware to ensure its safety and reliability for human testing. In tandem, the researchers will develop an animal model to perform crucial psychophysical and electrical-stimulation studies. Such a model would provide quantitative results on using a 1,000-plus array of electrodes to talk to the visual cortex. Once dismissed by many as pointless, advances in psychophysical research now allow scientists to track the eye movement of animals, helping researchers to understand what they see.\"Today, you can set up training tasks where you can pretty well determine what these animals are looking at,\" says Troyk. \"If we're going to learn how to talk the language of the brain, we need to be able to do hundreds of thousands of trials in a systematic, quantitative manner, something you can't get with human volunteers because of the inevitable time lapse between experiments and the unreliability of self-reporting.\"Although Troyk predicts that human implants are at least five to ten years away, the animal trials could alter that schedule. \"If the first animal experiments of the intra-cortical prosthesis prove spectacularly successful\u2014which I wouldn't rule out\u2014we would prepare the hardware for human trial as quickly as possible. \"Troyk defines spectacular results as \"the ability of the animals to recognize lines in a variety of orientations, dots in different locations in the visual field, and motion in one direction vs. motion in another direction. If we were to get those three types of features, we would have access to the primary features normally used to construct images in our brains. In other words, we would have the building blocks of vision.\"In addition to the project's technology focus, researchers will address key psychological and ethical issues associated with implants of an intra-cortical visual prosthesis in human subjects.will lead focus groups of blind individuals to ensure that the technology being developed meets their expectations about useful vision. Actively soliciting and studying the opinions of the blind in this coordinated manner would be a first, and could help researchers understand the threshold of utility for a future implantable device, as well as help identify the best implant candidates., director of IIT's Center for Study of Ethics in the Professions, has also been designated to oversee an ongoing ethical review process. As Troyk notes, \"We're entering pioneering territory of man-machine interfaces. When you're implanting hardware in the brain, the risks can be significant, and must be properly weighed against the benefits. For instance, we might not be able to justify potentially risky brain surgery if all we can provide blind individuals is 'Lite-Brite' or scoreboard images. Ongoing input from ethicists will also help ensure that as researchers, we balance the expectations of blind individuals with their understanding of the technology's capabilities, so that in our zeal, we don't exploit the vulnerability of patient volunteers during experiments.\"While the IIT-led team has devised a project that ensures free and multiple exchanges of information, Troyk is adamant about avoiding publicity in the popular press. He's declined every media request for an interview since IIT began working on the project in 1996. \"There's an aspect of reporting in this field that's destructive to the research,\" says Troyk, \"particularly if other researchers perceive that what's being reported is not only inaccurate, but self-promoting. The fact is that nobody has anything that is ready to cure blindness in anybody.\"Ironically, Troyk has witnessed the upside of unwelcome publicity. In January 2000, awriter called Troyk for comment on a reported surface-electrode brain implant in a blind volunteer. He declined. However, when the article \"Now, Electronic 'Eyes' for the Blind\" appeared, it contained one sentence about IIT's brain implant research. The reference caught the attention of a philanthropist, who sent a consultant with whom he regularly works to check out the project. After a few meetings to investigate the team's research, the philanthropist issued a check that would aid the team in their pursuit. Troyk isn't at liberty to divulge the amount of the donation (sizable) or the donor's identity (an internationally recognized figure). Nevertheless, that donation, coupled with other private contributions, ensured that IIT's visual-prosthesis research would be able to continue, in anticipation of new NIH funding.Though making progress in this groundbreaking research is a thrilling enough motivation in itself, Troyk is driven by is the human benefit that the work would have in helping blind individuals overcome their social isolation. \"We're not merely interested in showing an individual with blindness the outline of a doorway\u2014you can use a seeing-eye dog to do that,\" Troyk says. \"What could be more rewarding is that one day, using our technology, they could see their granddaughter's face, or gaze upon Renaissance paintings. These are things that most of us take for granted.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/still-game", "content": "may have spiked her final ball as captain of the 2014 IIT Scarlet Hawks women's volleyball team last October, but she's found a way to inspire student-athletes using an off-court strategy\u2014by taking the spring Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course IIT Pride: Improving Student and University Community Engagement.Last fall the Walled Lake, Mich., native completed playing all four of her allotted seasons and wanted to use her fifth year at IIT College of Architecture to share some of her real-world student-athlete tips within the real-world environment of the IPRO Program.

She notes that such a project would involve all students on Main Campus, not only student-athletes, and would help to spread a sense of pride\u2014and fun\u2014throughout the IIT community.Steve Hammond, course instructor and IIT Institute of Design adjunct faculty member, says that Duman is one of two student-athletes out of 12 total students taking this semester's IIT Pride, which aims to deepen the connection students have with the university. He notes that, in general, student-athletes in the IPRO have contributed much as both supporters and recipients of Hawk pride.\"Athletes understand intimately that sporting events bring the IIT community together,\" he says. \"And we go beyond athletics. They have brought their discipline and enthusiasm to projects like the Mr. and Ms. Hawk event and the development of IIT apparel through design contests and student market research.\"Duman follows in the footsteps of psychology graduate student Roma Mirutenko, assistant coach of the IIT Scarlet Hawks women's volleyball team, who was instrumental in further refining the IIT Pride course when she played for the IIT volleyball team and served as Student Athletic Advising Committee president.\"I am excited that another athlete has joined the IPRO. Her passion as an athlete as well as a student who desires to increase school spirit is what the school really needs,\" says Mirutenko. \"She has seen how other schools of our size foster school spirit at home games and on campus, which will be helpful when trying to raise IIT's Hawk pride.\"IIT Pride:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/promoting-playtime", "content": "Since first competing in soccer at the age of four, Courtney Budd has channeled her love of sports and fitness into her educational and career pursuits. Today she brings that dedication to her position as IIT's director of intramurals and recreation. This spring Budd joined the Illinois Tech Department of Athletics and strives toward the team's goal to reinvigorate the intramurals program and inspire students to \"get out and play.\"The program now features a new logo and a name change from Intramurals and Recreation to Recreational Sports and Fitness in addition to offering more non-traditional classes, including Zumba and kickboxing. Budd says there is something for everyone. Students may participate in leagues, tournaments, group fitness classes, and special events, such as last semester's IIT Color Run, the largest intramurals event in university history.During the spring semester, the department witnessed significant increases in student participation, with nearly three times the number of students than the fall semester. Most notable was the increase in participation among female students, with 16 times the number of participants.Budd has spent months planning this fall's Campus Cup Challenge and The Great IIT Race, which will mimic CBS's multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series,. Students have already benefited from the re-energized program. Sharuk Ashfak Majid (BMED 1st year), an international student from Bangladesh, says participating in intramurals enabled him to meet students from different majors, join his roommate in making it to the basketball quarter-finals, and stay healthy.\"The student experience is a huge focus at Illinois Tech, and recreational sports and fitness can have a positive impact on that,\" Budd says.That impact extends beyond improving the physical health of students. Budd recalls how sports taught her as many life lessons as it did soccer techniques.\"Playing organized sports taught me how to be confident, work with other people, and become a leader.\"Sports and physical fitness have been an integral part of Courtney Budd's life since she began playing soccer competitively at the age of four. She credits her parents with supporting her passion for athletic competition, one that also led to a full soccer scholarship to attend Valparaiso University in Indiana. Budd earned a Master of Higher Education Administration at North Park University while working as a graduate assistant, and as a senior operations manager with Junior Achievement of Chicago. Budd's responsibilities at North Park included managing the recreation facility, student workers, and the overall intramurals program. She has also coached club soccer at a competitive level and was an adjunct instructor at Robert Morris University."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015", "content": "Peter Matic and his team put their heads together to better protect the military against traumatic brain\u00a0injury.Lori Andrews has become the country's go-to bioethicist on subjects at the junction of law\u00a0and\u00a0medicine.Award-winning architect John Ronan is leading the design of IIT's new innovation\u00a0center.After 40 years in the biz, Bill Lidinsky knows a thing or two about cracking passwords and extracting covert\u00a0information.\"The best is yet to come.\" \u2014William Shakespeare As Illinois Institute of Technology celebrates its 125th anniversary, I am reminded of the many friends who have supported our university over the decades and all they have done to help us move forward.

A man knew he had been selected to participate in a top-secret mission and was given a train ticket to Chicago's Union Station. Once at the station, he was to make a telephone call for instructions. The voice at the other end of the phone told the man to stand in a certain area of the station holding a newspaper under his left arm. He would then be approached by another man, who would ask him if he were waiting for someone to pick him up. If his response was \"yes,\" the man with the newspaper was to give his companion a designated telephone number, which was the password to their final destination, place unknown to the man with the newspaper.IIT-educated scientist Peter Matic and his team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory put their heads together to gain a better understanding of how personal protective equipment can effectively shield military personnel from traumatic brain injury due to blast impacts.In the 1960s, \"The Jetsons\" cartoon creators Hanna-Barbera imagined the outer-space robot housekeeper of the future as Rosie, a sassy didactyl who was mostly successful at keeping the Jetson family's Orbit City apartment tidy.

Du, a doctoral candidate at IIT College of Architecture, says his longtime passion has been in improving cities-learning more about how they work, how they're organized, and how to keep them growing. He decided upon a career in architecture as a way to determine both how the building as a unit could play a more dynamic and sustainable role within its city family and how to encourage more people to make the city their home.According to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's obituary in the New York Times, S. R. Crown Hall (1956) was Mies' favorite design project, with the Chicago Federal Center [Everett M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, John C. Kluczynski Federal Building, and U.S. Post Office, Loop Station] (1964, 1973, 1974) being his second favorite.

A prolific inventor, de Forest, along with his business partner, E. H. Smythe, developed an improved telegraphic detector, which they called the responder, and conducted a series of wireless-transmission distance trials in the long hallways of Main Building as well as on its roof. In 1901 the duo met with further victory when they sent a signal-the letter \"h\" in Morse code-from the roof of Main Building to the now nonexistent Lakota Hotel at 30th Street and Michigan Avenue, about a half-mile from Main Campus.IIT Chicagoland Alumni Chapter leaders: [seated, left to right] Bob Hoel (BE '70), Lucy Hynes (EE '88), Natalie Hammer (EE '09, M.A.S.

Guided by terms stipulated in the will of benefactor Allen Cleveland Lewis, trustees tapped several prominent education visionaries to lead the institute, including William Rainey Harper and George Noble Carman, both on staff at the University of Chicago. By offering evening courses for the working class, Lewis Institute is considered to be the forerunner of adult education in the United States; its two-year Associate in Arts degree also makes it the first junior college. And Lewis's wishes to include a \"school for respectable females\" within the institute resulted in a bachelor's degree in domestic economy, with specialized coursework in the arts, sciences, and design to not only improve homemaking skills but also to form a foundation for a career in teaching.While the peacocks of IIT's Mies Campus\u2014S.

By the late eighteenth century these efforts had coalesced into a branch of medicine called, in which practitioners sought to quantify personality traits and mental acuity by measuring bumps on the human skull. The futility of this practice, also called \"bumpology\" was summed up perfectly by a famous Mark Twain anecdote in which he submitted himself, anonymously, to an examination by famous phrenologist Lorenzo Fowler. As the story goes, Fowler found a cavity where a bump 'should' have been and declared that this \"represented the total absence of the sense of humor\" in Twain.Oops.In the decades since, the study of personality has evolved into an empirical science, one that's at the heart of the discipline of industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. I/O psychology is a booming industry; the United States Department of Labor projects a 21 percent increase in the number of I/O jobs available over the next decade, the majority of those positions likely filled by candidates with graduate degrees.Although I/O psychology is a broad field that deals with a wide array of workplace- and human resources related subjects, pre-employment screening, \"selection\" is one of the most common that modern I/O psychologists tackle. Personality testing is a widely used measure of workplace compatibility.Joseph Wilkinson says that his own experience being tested for a job more than two decades ago\u2014a process he describes as \"time consuming, but interesting\"\u2014inspired him to seek out I/O psychology specialists when he and his partner opened their consulting business, Skalinder-Wilkinson and Associates, Inc. \"We decided to use the process to screen all 13 or 14 of the prospective employees for the firm,\" Wilkinson says, \"because we wanted to make sure our future employees were compatible with our company's culture.\" The results were nothing short of spectacular.\"In the 12 years we were in business, we only lost one employee,\" he says, adding that this lone defection was the result of a marriage, and not any sort of conflict. He says that the experience taught him a valuable lesson about testing and the selection process: \"Yes, occasionally the process will make mistakes, as these tests aren't infallible; but in cases where the tests indicate that a candidate is deficient for whatever reason, that's something I wouldn't recommend ignoring.\"\"I think more companies are testing today,\" says\u00a0Bruce Fisher (Ph.D. '84), director of the IIT Institute of Psychology's Center for Research and Service. The numbers bear this out: the testing industry has ballooned into a $400+ million industry with an estimated 8-10 percent rate of annual growth, and an array of (unsupervised) off-the-shelf tests are readily available to consumers. Of course, these off-the-shelf instruments have opened the door to inappropriately conducted testing, which in part is why testing has gotten somewhat of a bad reputation, at least in the press.\"There are a lot of tests out there that are not well developed, but have a tremendous amount of great marketing glitz to them,\" Fisher says. \"But they are not good tools, and they are neither valid nor legally defensible. Companies can get into trouble [using them].\"\"Personality tests, like any test\u2014indeed, any measurement\u2014yield scores that have errors, but you have to consider the alternative,\" explains Alan Mead, assistant professor at the institute and an expert in psychometrics, the science of psychological measurement. \"The idea that tests are worthless because they are not perfectly reliable and valid is exactly analogous to arguing that we should scrap the judicial system in this country because sometimes a guilty person is found innocent, or vice-versa.\"In fact, he adds, \"We have good reason and empirical support to assume that run-of-the-mill interviews have substantially lower validity and reliability than personality testing.\"Personality testing is but one tool that I/O psychologists have at their disposal when seeking to improve a company's selection methods. Fisher points out that companies with strong selection processes, are going to have other methods to get at the same type of data in a different way,\" what he calls a 'multi-method approach.' One example he offers is combining a personality test with a background check or an interview. \"You're looking, of course, for confirmatory data from the different methods,\" he says.As for interviewing, Fisher recommends a different methodology to help weed out potentially bad hires, a system called SAR, or \"Situation, Action, Result.\" He summarizes SAR with the hypothetical interview of a customer service agent: \"The question might be something like this: 'describe a time when you dealt with an exceptionally difficult, or unruly, customer.'\" Fisher explains that established guidelines help interpret a candidate's response; for example, a behavior profile is crafted by comparing how a candidate responds to an identical situation faced in the past by top-performing employees. This is called the \"critical incident method.\"Intelligence testing is another common tool of the selection process, but it's one that has been fraught with controversy\u2014namely allegations of bias against minority candidates. However, as a pure predictor of job performance, it's regarded as a very effective tool, particularly for executive positions. \"All other things being equal, there isn't a job in the world where it pays to be dumber,\" Mead notes dryly.\"Research shows that mental ability is the most critical and broadly generalizable facet in predicting executive success,\" says Fisher. He cites a recent statistic that roughly 25 percent of executive-level success can be accounted for solely by intellectual horsepower. Of the other 75 percent, Fisher says that there are many personality factors that are important, primarily traits like conscientiousness, integrity, persuasiveness, social confidence, and flexibility.Predicting executive success is a timely topic at IIT, who as of press date had three executive-level job openings: two deanships and a provostship. The university has hired recruitment firms to handle these nationwide candidate searches.The first step in executing such a search would be to pare down the pool of candidates, Fisher says hypothetically\u2014likely through a multiple interview process\u2014until only a group of finalists remain. From there, he says, \"We would typically recommend an assessment that is comprised of a battery of validated tests, both personality and cognitive ability, and then complement that with an in-depth interview\"\u2014all supervised by a qualified psychologist.Although Fisher isn't involved in IIT's current executive searches, he deals with these issues on a daily basis in his work directing the Center for Research and Service. \"If there's one thing that we feature as a core competency, it's that we're really good at helping companies measure human resources-related strategies,\" he says, \"in terms of how well they're working and where they can be investing.\" This includes measuring occupations through a psychometric (statistical) method known as \"job analysis,\" validating pre-employment testing, structuring employment interviews, designing performance appraisal methods, and evaluating the effectiveness of job training programs.Operated as a nonprofit entity, the center serves as a consulting firm for the institute, providing a revenue stream for research initiatives while allowing students to translate their classroom study into applied consulting experience. \"In fact,\" notes Fisher, \"I've come to see this as the most important aspect of the center.\" For example, the center's staff is currently engaged in research designed to enhance the utility of the 16PF, a common personality test. One such project uses item response theory to help ensure even better psychometric characteristics in future versions of the 16PF.While this real-world experience is crucial in preparing students for careers in I/O psychology, it also helps reinforce what students learn in the department's academic program. The curriculum is \"based on the scientist-practitioner model, with a mission to train students with broad knowledge of processes of human relationships in the workplace (organizational psychology) and policies and practices (personnel),\" explains Roya Ayman, director of the institute's I/O Psychology Training Program. \"It has a strong emphasis on methodology and quantitative aspects.\" The program is the oldest of its kind in Chicago, and was ranked sixth best in North America by TIP, a publication of the Society of Industrial/Organizational Psychology, in 2004.The institute offers students two tracks: the Personnel Human Resources Development track, in which students earn a non-thesis master's degree; and an I/O doctoral track, in which students compose a master's thesis and a dissertation, and receive a Ph.D. with a specialization in psychology. It's a highly selective program; Ayman estimates that only five to 10 students are admitted to the Ph.D. track annually. The program boasts a 100 percent placement rate for graduates\u2014exactly what you'd expect for such a select group of students who specialize in the science of occupational psychology.\"One of the more widely accepted theories\u2014although by no means universally accepted or a perfect theory\u2014is the idea that you can break down what we call personality into five different bins, sort of the global characteristics,\" says I/O Assistant Professor Alan Mead. \"The 'Big Five' is a common way of putting it.\"Although no two personality tests are created equal, Mead says that most use slightly different variations on the widely accepted Big Five model.Some common tests:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/ncaa", "content": "That Illinois Tech's director of athletics, Joe Hakes, is qualified to provide athletic vision and lead the university's efforts toward NCAA Division III membership is unquestionable.

But if you stop to consider that most of that is salt water, you begin to understand why the freshwater found in ice, rivers, lakes, streams, and underground aquifers must be carefully managed.Factor in myriad ways we use and rely upon water, and you begin to grasp the value behind the work being done at Digital H2O, a tech startup co-founded in 2012 by Brandon Pearlman (M.S. EMS '14).Digital H2O creates software tools that help energy companies more efficiently manage the water used in the drilling and production of gas and oil wells.The idea for the company flowed from Pearlman's entrepreneurial spirit and his background in management consulting, including a nearly six-year post as vice-president of a private equity firm focused on the renewable energy field.\"Through my work in the renewable energy space, I knew traditional fossil fuels were still an important part of the overall energy landscape. Then, I found a way to leverage my background, software, and a lack of market transparency to bring efficiency around water-management operations,\" explains Pearlman, who serves as Digital H2O's chief operating officer and head of product development. \"Companies that drill for oil and gas still care about the environment, and they want to be good stewards. One area where they can make a meaningful impact is with their water usage.\"When drilling a new well, energy companies inject a high-pressure mix of water, sand, and chemicals into rock to fracture it and release the oil or gas, which then flows into the well and is recovered. The entire process takes up to 3 million gallons of water per well. Each well also produces wastewater as a byproduct, which must be recycled, treated, or stored in a disposal well.Digital H2O's software platform, Water Asset Intelligence (WAI), provides built-in algorithms and a database of water observations\u2014including production data from existing gas and oil wells in a given geographic area\u2014that allow companies to benchmark or predict such things as water use, wastewater production, and the availability and capacity of disposal wells.The overall aim is to help energy companies quantify and reduce their water consumption.\"A lot of them lack a holistic understanding when it comes to the water component and, if you can't understand it, you can't optimize it from an environmental or a cost standpoint,\" Pearlman says. \"These guys want to do both.\"WAI currently provides data and analysis for drilling operations in Texas and will soon expand the platform to include New Mexico. By the close of 2015, Pearlman projects the software will include every state nationwide that is involved in gas or oil exploration. He also has his eye on expansion into Canada and possibly other countries depending upon market demand.\"We have a real water scarcity issue in the world,\" he says. \"My hope is that by helping oil and gas companies better manage this scarce resource there will be a net positive effect on the overall water landscape. That means less competition for water used for oil and gas production versus agriculture or drinking water. That's the green, sustainable impact.\"\"Chicago Is the Place for a Fracking Software Startup?

Rather than modify the petunia's DNA to produce a flower colored by non-plant molecules (as with the), or modify the production of anthocyanins in the petunia, the Revolution Bio team is creating a color change by controlling genes that modify the anthocyanin environment with the plant's circadian clock.\"With the circadian clock\u2014people have it, plants have it, animals, too. We are using that clock to time a change in color,\" Havens says of the mechanism within us that dictates our body's 24-hour cycle as it relates to our environment. \"Anthocyanins are sensitive to their environment, so when you change this environment of these molecules you change the color.\"Havens, who grew up among pink and purple sweet pea flowers, fragrant gardenia, and lush hills in Hawaii, says that she hopeswill help \"jump start a conversation about nature, technology, and society, and how we all interact.\"She adds, \"Maybe our pretty flowers don't contribute to a cure for diabetes, but maybe they will encourage people to view biotechnology in a new way\u2014to view it as a technology with possibilities instead of harm.\"Revolution Bio has launched acampaign to help further develop.

In search of good jobs, decent housing, and basic freedoms, African Americans traveled from the South to points north and west in what is known as the Great Migration. According to the City of Chicago, the city's African-American population grew nearly 150 percent from 1910 to 1920, reaching a population of 110,000 by 1920. The Black Belt became a largely self-sufficient and thriving area.During its zenith in the 1920s, the area on and east of present-day IIT Main Campus was a city in miniature, sustained by successful businesses, entrepreneurship, political leadership, and cultural creativity. Although migration from the South continued until around 1970, the original Black Belt began to decline in the early 1930s under the impact of the Great Depression. Additionally, the striking down of racially restrictive covenants by the United States Supreme Court in 1948 provided opportunities for upwardly mobile residents of Bronzeville to move beyond its historic boundaries.Today's Bronzeville (whose southern border extended over the years to 47th Street) remains a hub of African-American life. Community organizations and the City of Chicago have been working to revitalize the area through rehab projects, mixed-use development, and new business ventures.In 1998 the City of Chicago accorded Chicago Landmark status to nine Bronzeville structures: Unity Hall, the Chicago Defender Building, Sunset Caf\u00e9, the Eighth Regiment Armory, the Liberty Life/Supreme Life Building, Victory Monument, the Overton Hygienic Building, the Chicago Bee Building, and the Wabash Avenue YMCA. For more information about these landmark structures, click. Additionally, in 1994, the city accorded Chicago Landmark status to the South Side Community Art Center.As part of the Chicago Public Art Program, sculptor Alison Saar was commissioned to create thein commemoration of the African-American men and women who traveled from the South to Chicago after the Civil War. The bronze figure waves a hand in welcome and stands atop a mound of worn shoe soles signifying the often arduous journey to the North.Unity Hall served the Jewish community in the late 1800s as the Lakeside Club social organization. For many years beginning in 1917, the building served as a center of African-American political activity headed first by city councilman Oscar DePriest and then by prominent Democratic political leader William Dawson.Built in 1899 as a Jewish synagogue, the Chicago Defender Building housed thenewspaper from 1920\u20131960. Founded in 1947, theis largely credited for helping to empower African Americans in the South to move to the North for a life of new opportunities.Now housing Meyers Ace Hardware, the Sunset Caf\u00e9 building was a nightclub in the 1920s and '30s that confirmed Chicago's reputation as a jazz mecca. Trumpeter Louis Armstrong and pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines often accompanied the caf\u00e9's house orchestra, while music legends Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Bix Beiderbecke, and Jimmy Dorsey joined in on nightly jam sessions.This structure was built in 1914\u201315 to serve the \"Fighting 8th,\" an African-American volunteer military regiment. During World War I, the Eighth Regiment was incorporated into the 370th United States Infantry. The former armory is now the home of the Chicago Military Academy\u2013Bronzeville, a public high school.The Bronzeville Visitor Information Center now occupies a portion of this building, which served as the headquarters of the first African-American owned and operated insurance company in the northern United States. Liberty Life Insurance Co. was incorporated in 1919 and set up offices in the building; through a merger a decade later, it grew into the Supreme Life Insurance Company of America and remained in business until 1992.Composed of three sculpted bronze panels on a granite shaft, the Victory Monument was dedicated on Armistice Day 1928. It honors the triumphs of the Eighth Regiment when members served in France during World War I as part of the Illinois National Guard unit of the 370th United States Infantry.Built in 1922\u201323, this Chicago Landmark is named for African-American entrepreneur Anthony Overton, who commissioned the structure to house the headquarters of his cosmetics company. Several other prominent businesses were located here, including Douglass National Bank, the first nationally chartered, African-American owned bank.The only area building featuring the Art Deco architectural style, the Chicago Bee Building housed the, a newspaper Anthony Overton founded in 1926 to promote African-American businesses and issues. Today, the building operates a branch of the Chicago Public Library.Opened to the public in 1913, the Wabash Avenue Young Men's Christian Association assisted the influx of African Americans from the South in many ways. Besides providing recreational activities, the YMCA assisted arrivals in finding jobs and housing. It continues to serve the Bronzeville community today.Founded in 1940, the South Side Community Art Center is the oldest African-American art center in the United States. The mission of the SSCAC is to preserve, conserve, and promote the legacy and future of African-American art and artists while educating the community on the value of art and culture."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/forever-photos", "content": "It seems fitting that S.

The article was called 'Chicago Blues,' and detailed the city's failure to capitalize fully on the '90's economic boom. But on the computer screen ofgraduate student Jeff Ettenhofer ('01), the magazine's cover has been artfully altered using Photoshop to read, 'Chicago Rules.'Ettenhofer and four of his ID classmates, Joanna Barth, Matt Beebe, Tim Murphy, and Jeff Tull, teamed up during the 2000-2001 school year to bring their design skills to bear on one facet of Chicago's regional economic problem: transportation. They worked under the advisement of Chicago Metropolis 2020, a not-for-profit group initiated by thethat seeks to ensure the preeminence of the region by addressing a broad range of vital issues, including transportation. Over the course of the year, the students designed a system of interlocking products, services and business concepts that would shift individual behavior in ways that reduce congestion and benefit the larger community.'One of the reasons I came to ID was the prospect of solving large-scale problems and making a real difference in the world,' said Ettenhofer. 'Regional transportation seemed like a really hot topic with the potential to affect a lot of people.'Among the students' broad range of 'solution elements' (concepts for products, services, and processes that make up the system) were: Progress Points, an artificial currency that rewards commuters for choices that reduce congestion, like driving at off-peak times; Working Lots, a new venture concept that transforms ordinary parking lots into delivery centers for groceries, dry cleaning, and other goods and services that currently necessitate an inordinate amount of congestion-causing trips; and Regional Decision Center, a high-tech meeting space that enables regional planners and decision-makers to work more efficiently toward transit solutions that satisfy common regional goals.Over the course of the school year, the student team, who called themselves TransitLab and their project ViaChicago, received ongoing feedback on their ideas from Metropolis 2020's leaders and other civic officials. The team's relationship with the not-for-profit group proved to be one of the most valuable parts of the project.'Metro 2020's goals, and the people they know, are really interesting,'\u00a0said Ettenhofer. 'Mayors, transportation planners\u2014people who help structure our entire society. Their influence is huge. Regularly presenting our ideas to such an influential group forced us to think even harder about them and really get our story straight.' The team presented their evolving ideas to Metro 2020 several times over the course of the year, culminating in a final presentation to a group of transportation officials and regional mayors in the spring.After the regular school year, Ettenhofer and teammate Matt Beebe continued in a summer internship foron a different topic: visualizing on paper the complex network of not-for-profit groups that share Metro 2020's interests. After surveying the various groups and describing them in a standardized way, the designers created a detailed, poster-sized chart showing the web of relationships. Metro 2020 officials plan to unveil this document to other members of the network and to funding agencies, using it as a tool for developing more effective forms of collaboration.Although the TransitLab team graduated from ID in the spring of 2001, other ID students are continuing to work on projects under Metro 2020 advisement. This year, a new student team is focusing on the issue of land development and affordable housing, which is another of Metro 2020's primary goals.'Observation of real people is the basis of (projects like these),' says TransitLab advisor Greg Prygrocki, associate professor at the Institute of Design. 'Deep involvement with an outside institution gives students clearance to ask questions and get feedback that they wouldn't otherwise have.'"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2008/beauty-birds", "content": "Urban bird watchers, take heart. The wonder and wildness of the natural world are right in Chicago, in those special areas where the sidewalks meet the soil, where the buildings yield to the trees. IIT Professor Geoffrey A. Williamson has visited many such special areas. One of his favorite avian-inspired nature memories is of a winter evening cross-country skiing with a friend at the Marovitz Golf Course in Lincoln Park.\"It was very picturesque that night. What had been a light drizzle had changed to snow as the temperature had just dropped below freezing. A fresh coating of pure white snow was everywhere and there was a coating of ice over all the trees,\" says Williamson. \"My friend and I had spotted what we thought might be a snowy owl on top of a spruce tree. We stopped skiing and looked at it in the faint light, trying to decide if it was an owl or maybe just a plastic bag. Finally, we decided it was a plastic bag. We then swished forward on our skis, making what really was a snowy owl take flight from the top of the tree, which then shook a little. The owl was totally silent, making no noise at all as it flapped off, the only sound being a cascade of tinkling as little ice crystals tumbled down through the spruce tree.\"Williamson is more than a casual bird watcher\u2014he is a birder, someone who takes a more dedicated approach in their observations, engaging in the hobby at many different levels. He has seen nearly 650 different types of birds across the United States and has traveled to Peru and Costa Rica to observe the bird life in those countries. If you have gone on a Chicago Ornithological Society () bird walk in Lincoln Park's North Pond area, Williamson may have been your guide, as he has conducted more than 275 walks in the Chicago area and elsewhere.Besides leading walks for the COS, Williamson has served as the group's president and has been a member of its board as well as the board of the; he is currently its membership secretary. He is the compiler, or organizer, of the Lisle-Arboretum Christmas Bird Count and is also co-editor for the Illinois and Indiana region of North American Birds, the journal of ornithological record published by the.Birding has been a family affair for Williamson, who met his birder wife, Christine, when he moved from New York to Illinois and joined the COS. He became interested in birds at age 8 thanks to his parents, who gave him a field guide that he and his brother, Joel, consulted as they took their own bird walks around the pond next to their home. Williamson's interest accompanied him to graduate school at Cornell University, where he began his birding activities in earnest\u2014joining a bird club, meeting other birders, participating in bird counts and surveys, and traveling just to look at birds. When he is able, Williamson tries to piggyback birding side trips onto out-of-state work-related events he attends. At a spring research conference in Las Vegas, Williamson hopes to find the time to look for Le Conte's thrasher, a bird of the desert Southwest that he has not yet seen.Closer to home, Williamson has observed a type of predatory bird that has made IIT's Main Campus its winter abode for the past several years: not Talon, the IIT Scarlet Hawk, but a Cooper's hawk, and likely, more than one. Williamson saw it for the first time in the tree by George Segal's Man on a Bench sculpture. \"It is pretty unusual to have a bird like this roost in a spot that does get a fair bit of foot traffic going by,\" he says, noting that the population of Cooper's hawks is on the increase in Illinois. They can be seen across the state throughout the year, particularly during the spring and fall migrations.\"The bird seems to pay no heed to the various university folks who walk under its tree. Probably most of those people have no idea the bird is there,\" he says. According to Williamson, the hawk seems to spend the day hunting for its typical diet of small birds, which it probably finds in the neighborhoods around Main Campus or along the Metra tracks, flying back to its tree roost for the night.David Baker, vice president of IIT's Department of External Affairs, has seen the campus hawk and is a birder who has learned much from his colleague. \"He demonstrates a boundless enthusiasm, which rubs off on all of us in strange ways,\" Baker says, as he recalls a December morning in 1998 when he and Humanities Professor Jack Snapper joined Williamson on an early morning \"owling\" expedition in the forest preserves near Argonne National Laboratory.\"In trying to see many different kinds of birds, you are led to visit a wide range of places that you might not go to otherwise.\"Although the temperature was only 4 degrees Fahrenheit, Williamson attempted to attract great horned and other varieties of owls the group was hoping to see using playback of tape-recorded owl calls. The extreme cold caused the recorder to fail, but the attempt was far from being unsuccessful, thanks to Williamson's Plan B. \"Undaunted, he then imitated the calls himself, yielding amazing return calls from the owls in the area around us,\" explains Baker. \"We covered the whole metropolitan area that morning and saw five different species of owls for our troubles.\"Williamson's birding avocation and his science vocation seem to share common traits. \"Every trip we have gone on together results in an email from him listing the exact number of species that we may have seen that day,\" says Baker. \"Geoff applies the same energy and precision to birding as he does to his academic and research work in electrical engineering.\" Williamson, who investigates system and signal analysis in various applications through the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is currently collaborating with two other institutions on a project studying the causes of kidney damage from high blood pressure and is focusing his efforts on the dynamic response of the microvasculature to blood pressure changes.While Williamson brings an energy and precision to his birding, birding brings to Williamson a rewarding way to experience the natural world. He explains that a reason why birding is so rewarding is that both seeing and identifying a particular bird can be quite challenging. But it is a challenge Williamson relishes. \"In trying to see many different kinds of birds, you are led to visit a wide range of places that you might not go to otherwise.\" For Williamson, this may mean a trip to as yet unvisited corners of the country in search of his 651st bird, while for others it may be as simple as standing at the base of the Man on a Bench tree and looking up."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2008/wiser-path-sustainability", "content": "\"I believe the world is going to have to massively revise its energy supply and consumption patterns over the next several decades,\" reflects Ralph L.

There is no way we are going to be able to continue to have growth in the United States or the rest of the world unless we can solve some of these energy problems.\"How to go about solving some of the world's energy problems is something that Ralph Wanger has considered seriously. With his observation that \"nothing happens in science and engineering that doesn't involve energy,\" perhaps it should come as no surprise that Wanger has entrusted the task of discovering an energy solution to a university with strengths in both science and engineering. He has done so with a $5 million pledge to establish the IIT Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research ().A graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Wanger chose IIT as the recipient of his benevolence because \"a gift to IIT has more effect on the school than a gift to MIT would,\" explains Wanger. \"MIT is a larger, richer place at the top level of engineering schools. IIT is in the position for a lot more change and a lot more interesting projects. It will be a more effective gift.\"Wanger knows about anticipated yields on investments. For 33 years, he was manager of the Acorn Fund, one of the nation's top-performing growth funds. He and his wife, Leah Zell, are principals of their management firm LZW Group, LLC. Wanger became an analyst in 1960 for, eventually becoming a portfolio manager. In 1970, he established the enormously successful Acorn Fund, increasing its assets from $8 million to more than $13 billion during the years he managed the fund. During this time, Wanger left Harris to start Wanger Asset Management, LP before becoming an LZW principal in 2005. He has been featured in major newspaper and financial publications, and wrote the book, published in 1997.The WISER gift is not the first that Wanger has made to bring a sense of excitement and renewal to IIT. In 2004, he and Leah donated $1 million to the Mies Society for renovation of the south porch of S. R. Crown Hall, home of the IIT College of Architecture.\"He's an incredibly creative individual who has a sincere interest not only in helping IIT advance, but also in contributing to society by promoting initiatives that contribute to sustainability, especially in the energy area,\" says IIT President John L. Anderson. \"Ralph told me that he hopes WISER will give IIT opportunities to partner with other universities in both research and education. Our goal is to have WISER internationally recognized for both its research and educational programs.\"Officially launched on March 3, 2008, WISER will expand upon the work of the Energy and Sustainability Institute (ESI), created in 2004 through IIT Armour College of Engineering. \"Ralph Wanger's gift gives us great potential to go well beyond our initial aspirations for ESI,\" says Anderson of ESI's aim to develop state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary education and research programs, and to promote commercialization of some of the new ideas in areas related to energy and sustainability.Hamid Arastoopour (M.S. GE '75, Ph.D. '78), Armour dean, newly appointed Linden Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and recognized authority in particle technology and energy conversion systems, and Henry R. Linden (Ph.D. CHE '52), Max McGraw Professor of Energy and Power Engineering and Management, were cofounders of ESI. Arastoopour acknowledges that Wanger's gift will enable the university, through WISER, to build upon its existing strengths in energy and sustainability as well as to expand into new project areas. \"Mr. Wanger's gift is going to provide us with needed infrastructure, seed money for faculty research, and scholarships to attract top students,\" says Arastoopour.He says two elements set IIT apart from most other universities that have sustainability initiatives: a long track record of conducting energy research and a large and experienced faculty working together in an interdisciplinary environment. Arastoopour cites the example of architecture faculty collaborating with engineering faculty on wind and solar energy projects. In his analysis of initiatives at other universities with comparably sized sustainability programs to WISER, Arastoopour notes that each had received substantial funding from industry and government grants, which made a difference in what they could accomplish. Wanger's gift will give IIT the competitive edge it was lacking.Linden, director of IIT'sand architect of energy activities at IIT, says the gift will give the university the chance to do much more to address what he sees as \"the critical issue of our times.\" An IIT faculty member since 1954, Linden is a recognized authority in national and international energy economics and policy, and has spent his career researching, developing, and implementing sustainable global energy technology. \"It has given us a real boost in going forward and a basis for raising other similar gifts to establish the institute,\" says Linden of Wanger's contribution. He is optimistic that the funding will make it easier to obtain the large corporate, state, and federal grants to help the institute attain its goal of establishing IIT as a national leader in energy and environmental and sustainability issues, complementing Chicago's emergence as a forward-thinking city.IIT took its first steps on the road to becoming an energy leader some 60 years ago, when it became affiliated with the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) and began a graduate program in gas engineering and joint research endeavors. While IGT ended the graduate program in 1985, the Gas Research Institute, under Linden's direction, provided IIT funding to hire faculty in the energy arena. Arastoopour was brought on to lead the new Energy Technology Program, resulting in the development of an energy specialization education program, expanded energy research, industry involvement, and the endowed chair that Linden occupies. In 2004, the ESI was established, providing opportunities for all of IIT's colleges, schools, and centers to engage in energy and sustainability activities.Under WISER, the university will build upon its strengths in four focus areas: energy production (clean coal technology); renewable energy (solar energy/hydrogen storage and fuel cells); energy efficiency, conservation, and sustainability (hybrid systems and sustainable buildings); and power and power distribution (security and the Galvin Electricity Initiative). Centered about these four areas of research, faculty from various disciplines within Armour College will continue to develop enterprising approaches toward a sustainable future.Linden defines sustainability as meaning \"an inexhaustible, emission-free supply of energy.\" A significant problem in coal burning\u2014the major source of our nation's electricity\u2014is the generation of fossil fuel emissions, such as carbon dioxide, sulfur, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, which are responsible for adding to the planet's greenhouse gas effect and polluting the environment. Arastoopour and Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (ChBE) Distinguished Professor Dimitri Gidaspow (Ph.D. GT '62) have developed mathematical models for a coal gasification process, the conversion of coal into gas. Their work, supported by the National Science Foundation (), the Department of Energy (), and industry, earned accolades from the American Institute of Chemical Engineering. ChBE GTI Associate Professor Javad Abbasian (M.S. GE '78, Ph.D. '86) is finding ways to remove carbon dioxide and sulfur from coal flue gas using high temperatures, and has successfully developed a novel sorbent, or sulfur-removing compound. Herek Clack, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering (MMAE), is investigating ways to remove mercury from the flue gas that results from the burning of coal.\"Renewable energy, such as solar or wind, is not available continuously; therefore, we need to store produced electricity using high-capacity batteries or convert produced electrons to molecular form, such as hydrogen, then store it,\" explains Arastoopour. ChBE Research Associate Professor Said Al-Hallaj (Ph.D. CHE '00) is coordinating renewable energy initiatives for WISER through the Energy + Power Center. Several demonstration projects funded by the State of Illinois, the City of Chicago, and other entities are in progress, including a solarhydrogen hybrid fuel cell that powers an LED sign. One of Al-Hallaj's newest projects is the development of a hybrid scooter that is powered by a battery, a fuel cell, and hydrogen gas. ChBE Distinguished Research Professor J. Robert Selman, in collaboration with Al-Hallaj, was awarded a patent in March 2007 for an electrostatic spray used in fuel cell technology. Research on the development of inexpensive and high-performance electrochemical fuel-cell systems is under the direction of ChBE Professor Jai Prakash, who is focusing his efforts on the integration of batteries, fuel cells, and capacitors in renewable power/energy systems.Through his startup company, All Cell Technologies, LLC,is collaborating with Ali Emadi, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of IIT's Electric Power and Power Electronics Center, on the conversion of a City of Chicagointo a plug-in hybrid. With a battery that can be recharged by connecting a plug into an electric power source, a plug-in hybrid vehicle does not require any fossil fuel during its all-electric range if its battery is charged by a renewable energy source.Emadi has led IIT research initiatives on the development of electric-hybrid vehicles and motor drive technology. Emadi's two-pronged approach to hybrid systems consists of using already-built components in the conversion of traditional vehicles into hybrid vehicles and creating unique components for hybrid electric conversion kits. The kits are being developed in conjunction with Emadi's startup company,, and are expected to be ready for the market in 2009.Imagine living in a house in the heart of the city that largely relies upon its own capabilities to supply heat and electricity while doing so in ways that contribute to a sustainable future. In 2005, ESI began plans for the creation of such a residence in the House of the Future initiative. Project leaders Arastoopour and Al-Hallaj are planning to incorporate such energy-efficient features as a solar roof, reversible metering, and a small wind turbine to help generate the building's energy needs. This demonstration facility, to be erected on Main Campus, will serve as a sustainable showcase and science teaching laboratory for students in the local community as well as IIT students, several of whom drew up plans for the proposed design. In another project, IIT College of Architecture Professor Peter Land, an authority on tall buildings, and MMAE Associate Professor Dietmar Rempfer are collaborating on developing high-rises that effectively utilize wind turbines to produce the energy needs of buildings that have multiple housing units.\"Perfect Power\" is a term that may sound impossible to accomplish, especially in regards to the electrical demands of a city. But in 2005, Motorola, Inc. founding family member, Bob Galvin, along with sons Chris and Mike, formed thein an attempt to achieve just that. Two of the power experts they approached to help create a prototype of the perfect power system were ECE Chair and Carl Bodine Professor Mohammad Shahidehpour and Associate Professor Alex Flueck, who, under WISER, will continue working on their design of a series of \"intelligent\" micro-grids powered by IIT and ComEd that would conform to the ways electricity is being used and adjust its flow rate accordingly. Such a system would result in less energy waste, ultimately reducing the need for fossil fuels.Impending shortages of natural resources, an ever-increasing world population, and the long-term effects of emissions produced in the manufacture of energy have made sustainability the catchword of the 2000s. With a history in energy research, an interdisciplinary team of thinkers and doers, and a vision to preserve the Earth's resources and environment for future generations, IIT is committed to taking on an increased leadership role in sustainability issues. \"IIT Stuart School of Business introduced the sustainability concept into its graduate Environmental Management Program in 1999,\" says George P. Nassos, industry associate professor, adding that the following year, thewas established at Stuart. Nassos says that the center is a founding member of the Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance, an organization of nearly 160 members all striving for the advancement of sustainability.Additional projects, such as the development of alternate sources of natural gas and the production of efficient and cost-effective biofuels, are underway at Armour and will continue to grow and perhaps even expand in new directions under WISER. \"I envision the faculty from WISER will be consulted on energy policy and national research strategies,\" says Anderson. \"Our goal is to promote WISER beyond Chicago, especially in Washington, D.C., and internationally.\" He adds that WISER should increase research and education opportunities for all students. \"WISER represents a major theme of the university, embracing participation by all of our colleges,\" he says.Ralph Wanger sees the promise of a sustainable future in IIT's students. \"Sustainability is going to be one of the key long-term problems over the life of someone entering IIT as a student today. I believe the ability to have a program of this nature will attract highly qualified students and be good for the reputation of the school,\" he explains. \"I think everybody is enthusiastic and eager to make something that will be good for IIT, good for students, and good for America.\"A radio-controlled electric car race that pitted WISER benefactor and trustee Ralph L. Wanger against IIT President John L. Anderson capped an informative, thought-provoking, and at times, just plain fun WISER launch celebration, held on March 3 on IIT's Main Campus.The academic colloquium portion of the event featured talks by IIT faculty as well as Charles Maxwell, energy analyst for Weeden & Co. Hans Maru (M.S. CHE '70, Ph.D. '75), retired chief technology officer and executive vice president of FuelCell Energy, Inc., delivered the plenary address, \"Where Are the Fuel Cells?\" Before introducing Maru, John W. Rowe, chair of the IIT Board of Trustees and utilities-industry leader for more than 24 years, briefly shared his view on new directions in energy. Rowe maintains that a successful transition from society's carbon-incumbent lifestyle will involve a combination of energy-efficiency practices, the increased use of natural gas as a bridge fuel, and an increased acceptance of nuclear power in energy generation. \"I continue to believe that the nation must come to terms with nuclear power,\" said Rowe. \"I can't see how we have an energy future with electricity below 20 cents per kilowatt hour unless we have a significant goal for nuclear.\"Wanger's sentiment, made at the event's conclusion, served as a poignant summary of why sustainability should matter. \"I'm very worried about my granddaughter, Katherine, who is here,\" he said. \"I'd like to make sure that she grows up in a healthy, safe, and prosperous world. This is my gift to Katherine to help make her a happy and productive adult.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2002/lohan-drawn-iit", "content": "As anyone who has visited IIT's Main Campus in the past two years can see, there is a physical transformation underway. The blueprint for IIT's architectural and landscape rejuvenation is referred to as the Main Campus Master Plan. The chief mind behind the redesign is Dirk Lohan, a grandson of Mies van der Rohe. Lohan has worked on such buildings as the, the, and a recent plan calling for a makeover ofon Chicago's lakefront. But it's the IIT Main Campus Master Plan that most directly continues a link to Lohan's grandfather, Mies van der Rohe, designer of the initial campus master plan, and the man who invited Lohan to IIT to study architecture when he was 18 years old.Lohan's first visit to America from his native Germany was to attend IIT during the 1957-58 school year. 'By the end of that year I knew two things,' Lohan said. 'First, I was sure I wanted to be an architect. And second, I knew I wanted to return to America\u2014it was such a stimulating and free atmosphere over here compared to what I was used to in Germany.'Lohan wound up returning to the U.S. for good in 1962, after graduating from the. He began his independent practice in 1969, and is now an IIT trustee and chairman of the board's facilities committee. He also served for several years as chairman of the Board of Overseers for the.Lohan has designed a number of corporate headquarters in addition to the cultural centers that he's worked on with Lohan Associates. These buildings include the home bases for TRW, Ameritech, McDonald's, and Frito-Lay, as well as the new One North Wacker Drive office building in Chicago, which incorporates the latest technologies for office innovation.In the news most recently is the adaptive re-use of Soldier Field, a joint venture with Wood & Zapata of Boston. Lohan's firm is primarily responsible for the, which would result in an improvement of the entire lakefront park, while Wood & Zapata is chiefly responsible for the architectural design of the stadium itself. The city's new front yard would allow for 17 new acres of additional waterfront parkland and 2,500 new underground parking spaces adjacent to the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium. New amenities for the stadium include expanded seating capacity for 61,500 fans, featuring improved sight lines and two state-of-the-art 84-foot video boards.The adaptive re-use of Soldier Field has been in the news a lot because of controversy over design or funding. Some community groups protest what would be a modernistic redesign of the stadium's classical look. 'Preservationists want to preserve things the way they are,' Lohan said. 'While we're interested in preserving the historic colonnades and facades of Soldier Field, a modern stadium within would bring vast public and civic improvements. Some are of the opinion that a modern football field inside an old-fashioned facade would be inappropriate. We, however, are interested in modifying the stadium by preserving some portion of it.'Lohan learned to handle major projects like this while working for his grandfather after completing architecture studies in Munich. During his early years with Mies' firm, he worked on major architectural endeavors like thein Berlin,and theoffice building in Chicago.It's been said that Lohan's signature has been to give the groundbreaking modernism of his grandfather's time a 'more human feel' by integrating contemporary and classical approaches to architecture, a style dubbed 'New Modernism.' In 1983 Lohan was appointed a Fellow by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) for his contributions to the profession, and Lohan Associates received the 1993 Firm Award from the.Lohan points to the redesign of IIT's Main Campus as something that will provide a contribution to the renaissance afoot in Chicago's South Side. 'The master plan calls for a number of innovations\u2014like the campus center and especially the student housing\u2014which will make State Street really the center of campus, uniting the east and west halves, rather than having what I used to call the 'Berlin Wall' in between. This will be a great improvement to the campus.'This plan addresses the next 20 years of growth for the university. It's a facilities plan that mirrors the strategic plan to attract more students, and simply answers the questions of where people would live and study,' Lohan continued.Since IIT's mission is to prepare students from all over the world to thrive in a climate of rapid technological change, it seems appropriate to have a campus that is continually updated. As the redesign is exemplary of something new mixing with the old, Lohan's involvement in the project brings an update to Mies' campus legacy."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2011/slideshow-autumn-iit-main-campus", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/125th-website", "content": "Did you know that Booker T.

But without cleverly designed commands, even supercomputers balk at the problems set before them\u2014a challenge of growing complexity, ironically, due in part to the increasingly powerful technology that drives these machines. Enter a new suite of intelligent algorithms to guide the computers of tomorrow to their targets.In a lively series of ads for the popular search engine, \"lame algorithms\" are dismissed as the very essence of uncool (never mind a longer path from points A to B). The savvy marketing team behind the campaign hopes to infuse a term once consigned to the unfashionable world of geek speak with newfound hipness. The time may be right. As it happens, all sequential processes, from sorting laundry to finding a route up Mt. Everest, are actually algorithms in disguise. Algorithmic recipes lead migrating herds to their watering holes and direct the formation of snowflakes and hurricanes.It is in the realm of computer science, however, where the algorithm reigns supreme. All machine programming is based on these lists of instructions, which begin at an initial input state and proceed to some point of termination, a path that revved-up technology is making more challenging to navigate.For researchers in the IIT Department of Computer Science (), smarter algorithms are a fundamental tool of the trade, designed, analyzed, and applied to diverse specialties, including information retrieval, wireless networking, market forecasting, computer simulation, and cryptography.The CS department came into being by fits and starts. IIT Professor, recruited to the IIT Department of Chemistry in 1955, had a keen interest in early computing, honing his skills on Argonne National Laboratory's IBM 650 computer. In 1959, Lykos introduced his chemistry majors to computing, instructing students to program a least-squares calculation of vapor pressure in a language known as Octal. Still, a fully fledged department devoted to computer science would have to wait.In the 1960s, Charles Bauer, then assistant principal of Lane Technical High School, began teaching programming courses to Chicago students, using IIT's facilities. The enthusiasm for computer science was infectious, with area teachers eventually enrolling in Bauer's courses as well.In 1971, with interest in computers mounting, the IIT CS department was founded. It quickly became the fifth largest department of the 25-department university, offering a range of CS classes, some of which persist today.Algorithms in one form or another have been around since humanity's earliest activities. The hunting algorithms used in modern search engines are, in some respects, remnants of the algorithmic strategies for finding game in prehistory. Computer scientists refer to \"greedy algorithms,\"\u00a0\"sorting algorithms,\"\u00a0\"genetic algorithms,\" and even \"ant algorithms\" (which mimic the statistical behavior of foraging insects).The term algorithm dates to the Persian astronomer, mathematician, and geographer Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose ninth century treatise was translated into Latin three centuries later as Algoritmi de numero Indorum. Long before al-Khwarizmi, simple algorithms had found their way into an array of early computing devices, including the abacus (invented in Babylonia in the fourth century B.C.) and in the first century B.C. the Antikythera mechanism (a prediction tool for stellar and planetary motion).By 1642, the philosopher-mathematician Blaise Pascal introduced a mechanical calculator. In the early 1820s, British mathematician Charles Babbage developed a large, steam-powered Difference Engine for calculating astronomical tables. Eventually, electricity, transistors, and microchip technology, along with a host of other innovations, revolutionized computers.Today, these fleet-footed machines leaf through billions of Internet documents per second, model conditions of ocean and atmosphere a century into the future, and even act as digital matchmakers, drawing our soul mates from ever deepening tide pools of personal data. Algorithms form the dynamic core of these applications.While algorithmic maneuvers in our daily lives can seem effortless, cajoling a machine into executing similar calculations can be daunting. As IIT Professor, a theoretician of algorithms, explains, \"The computer sees a problem one little piece of data at a time and that complicates things enormously.\"Imagine, for example, trying to find your way from New York's Upper West Side to the Lower East Side. A few glances at a good city map would probably be enough to guide you to your destination. But the computer essentially has to examine the city's maze of intersections one at a time, forgetting about those it has looked at already. As Reingold explains, \"If you boil the problem down to its essentials, you have an algorithm that manipulates a graph\u2014an idealized structure that has points and connections between the points.\" Today, sophisticated graph algorithms are at the heart of programs like Mapquest and Google Maps.IIT Professorexplains that algorithms need to do more than just provide accurate solutions. Simply put, a good algorithm has to accomplish its task quickly\u2014it has to be efficient. This is the point where the art of algorithm design emerges.Certain tasks like sorting playing cards by value and suit or arranging a group of seashells by color and shape can be handled rapidly by a variety of intelligent sorting algorithms. Adding more elements to be sifted and sorted increases the time required for the algorithm to finish the job, but the time increases almost linearly (actually, n log n). In mathematical jargon, such problems are solved in polynomial time.Other problems are far thornier, requiring exponential time to solve. That can cost dearly, because increasing the elements to be examined can quickly swamp computing resources. Such challenges are known to computer scientists as NP-hard problems.A classic case of NP-hard is the \"traveling salesman problem,\" or TSP. Here, a salesman is sent to visit a number of different cities on his rounds, returning to his starting place after stopping once at each destination. He wants to do this at the lowest cost (i.e., in the most efficient manner). The problem is easy to pose but much tougher to solve than one might think.As the number of cities to be visited by the salesman increases, the time required for a simple algorithm to crack the problem goes up exponentially. Thus, an algorithm that can deliver a solution for a 10-city trip in less than a second requires about 20,000 years of high-speed computing time when the problem expands to 20 cities!NP-hard problems are often subdued using approximation algorithms\u2014those that give a good, but not necessarily optimum, solution. The traveling salesman problem is critical for computer scientists because it recurs in endless variations and disguises, often requiring shrewd algorithmic solutions.Kapoor studies one such NP-hard problem: finding the equilibrium point in stock and commodity markets. As he explains, \"The question was raised by the French economist Leon Walras in 1874. How do these markets actually get to an equilibrium point? Or do they ever reach this point?\" Today, Kapoor and others are pursuing the question through methods including algorithmic game theory, a field at the intersection of economics and traditional computer science. Kapoor and his colleagues believe they have found a type of algorithm, known as an auction process, that can find the equilibrium price for a given set of traded commodities, given certain preconditions. This process occurs naturally in the real world. \"We showed that this mechanism can be made to work in polynomial time,\" Kapoor notes.Evolving algorithms also play a key role in network transactions, which today make up more than half of all Internet traffic, as Associate Professorpoints out. Li is the director of IIT's Wireless Networking Lab and applies his algorithmic design expertise to the unique challenges associated with network environments.File-sharing programs such asare among many so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) programs in which distributed users in the network act as both servers and receivers of information. One problem with these architectures is that individual users tend to act as selfish agents, maximizing their own benefits while in the process hindering the overall performance of the network. In his efforts to optimize the cost-benefit ratios intrinsic to network environments containing selfish users, Li also makes use of algorithmic game theory, among other strategies.Such approaches to problem solving find application well beyond the field of computer science, occasionally entering the geopolitical sphere. President John F. Kennedy's advisors, for example, deliberated over numerous algorithmic scenarios during the Cuban missile crisis, a classic case Li teaches to his students.Li and departmental colleagues Ophir Frieder, Nazli Goharian, David Grossman, Peng-Jun Wan, and Wai Gen Yee are members of IIT's, established to attack the problem of accessing useful data from the gargantuan and ever-growing sea of digitized information, both online and off.Frieder, director of the lab, insists that our search and retrieval headaches are far from over (notwithstanding the spectacular success of Google and its carefully guarded page-ranking algorithm). \"People think that 'search' has been solved,\" Frieder observes, taking issue with this common misconception. In addition to the needle-in-a-haystack quandary of finding relevant documents via standard search engines, there are all those other documents out there. Unlike the computer-readable pages Google hunts through, these \"real-world\" documents, as they are known, form a hodgepodge of scribbled notes, drawings, documents with watermarks or annotations, texts on corrupted paper, and so forth.One of many projects Frieder and his colleagues in information retrieval have worked on is the Complex Document Information Processing prototype that opened the world of real-life documents to powerful search capabilities. As a test bed for this software, the group used the, a storehouse of 42 million document images (roughly 1.5 terabytes) relating to the famous United States tobacco litigation. Many of the documents include handwriting, tables, signatures, and graphics along with standard text. Theis already using some of the outcomes of this research in its efforts.Other research in progress through the Information Retrieval Lab includes search technology that integrates multiple data types via IIT's patented Intranet Mediator, search technology for Arabic language materials, detection of computer misuse, sophisticated refinements in data mining, and P2P advances.Algorithms are presently undergoing a sea change, largely related to two technological trends.The first has to do with Moore's Law, an observation of computer hardware development over time. Though the pace of advance has been remarkable\u2014with processing speed doubling roughly every 18 months\u2014this windfall cannot continue indefinitely. Physical limitations will curb the design of faster microchips. Once this wall is reached, only better algorithms can improve performance, at least in traditional computing.The second trend\u2014known as parallel processing\u2014arose in part to circumvent these physical limitations. With parallel computing, many processors simultaneously chew away at a problem, rather than a single CPU working through its paces sequentially. The power of this technique has been enormous. Of course, there is a hitch: parallel computing also requires sophisticated new algorithms.is a specialty of IIT Professor, who works on the formidable challenges of designing parallel processing algorithms. He points out that parallel algorithms are becoming a necessity, not only in the rarified world of supercomputing but also for personal computing as well. New PCs with multiple CPUs built into so-called multi-core chips have already begun to shrink parallel computing down to size.Among Sun's early breakthroughs were algorithms designed for tridiagonal systems. These algorithms have been included in IBM'sand adopted as a community standard.More recently, Sun has attacked the problem of maintaining communications among multiple users operating on mobile devices such as PALM or other PDAs. When participants interact in real time\u2014for example, in an online game\u2014the communications to and from a user can be lost if the member moves out of the range of the particular wireless service station.The situation becomes much more complicated when multiple users are moving dynamically. Sun's new protocol\u2014an algorithm for coordination\u2014maintains communication states under process migration, so that interactions among multiple users can operate seamlessly. He and his student received a national award for this contribution.Reingold is adamant that theoretical research is crucial to the future of computer science. He points to earlier discoveries in pure mathematics that have since moved to the technological forefront. \"It's impossible to know today what will bear fruit in a decade or five decades,\" he stresses. \"That's one reason bluesky research can turn out to be very important. Cryptography is a terrific example of that.\"Composed of mathematics, not silicon, algorithms are endlessly flexible structures. In addition to their pride of place in computer science, algorithmic processes are embedded in nature, choreographing the movements of flocks of birds in flight and shoals of fishes under the sea. They are without limit, and will continue to shape the world.Peter Lykos introduces IIT chemistry majors to computing. It is the first known case in the United States of computer programming appearing as a requirement for a major course, according to the Charles Babbage Institute.Charles Bauer, assistant principal at Lane Technical High School, begins teaching Saturday morning programming courses for area high school students.Lykos establishes an M.S. program in computer science at IIT, from which there are graduates who pre-date the founding of a formal IIT Department of Computer Science (CS).The IIT CS department is founded, offering 35 undergraduate and graduate courses, making it the fifth-largest department in a 25 department university and the first CS department in the Chicago area. Robert Tobey is hired from Argonne National Laboratory as the first departmental chair.Carma McClure is awarded the first CS doctorate at IIT. McClure has written a number of books concerning the representation of\u00a0algorithms using diagrams and words to more clearly specify programs and improve usability and maintenance.Bauer retires from the Chicago public school system and becomes an associate professor of computer science at IIT. He remains at IIT as the longest-serving CS faculty member.With more than 600 students, the CS department is the largest unit within the IIT College of Science and Letters and one of the top 10 producers of computer science master's degrees in the United States. Graduates of the department have attained positions at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Motorola, Wolfram Research, and other leading companies."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2002/those-who-can-teach", "content": "As word problems go, this was a no-brainer: A wave of retirements nationwide will aggravate the already desperate shortage of math and science teachers; colleges of education are not producing enough qualified replacements; urban areas will be hit the hardest. Name an urban university with particular strengths in science and technology and the desire, ability and capacity to train the next generation of math and science teachers.When this problem began gaining increased attention a few years ago, the answer was obvious not only to IIT faculty, but to President Lew Collens, to executives of the, civic leaders, the state Board of Higher Education and principals of the public schools that ring IIT like bearings on a hub.In fact, says, vice president for external affairs, 'no program that I've been associated with at IIT has had higher outside support than this one.'The program, or programs, are the doctorate and master's degree tracks to be offered by the new, as well as a cluster of 21 credit hours for those undergraduates who want to specialize in the subject while completing a BS in a science, mathematics or engineering area. Master's classes began in fall, 2002. Bachelor's classes will start in the fall of 2002 pending state certification, which is expected this spring.Leading the department is Norman Lederman, a nationally renowned expert in scientific inquiry and the nature of science. Previously a professor of math and science education at, Lederman learned of IIT's plans from a search committee and soon arrived at the same answer as everyone else involved in the project.His reasons went beyond the obvious ones. Lederman was intrigued by IIT's(IPRO), which requires every undergraduate to participate in two interdisciplinary research projects. As a longtime believer that science is learned through personal inquiry, Lederman decided that IIT offered unusually fertile ground. 'There's something in place here that's not in place anywhere else,' he says.IIT's relative lack of history in education made the university more attractive (the university trained some of Chicago's best teachers in the '60s and '70s, but the program faded along with the Sputnik panic).\"One of the dreams I've always had would be to have total freedom,\"\u00a0he says. \"Because IIT doesn't have a program, doesn't have a school of education, doesn't have six or seven faculty that have been there for 100 years\u2026 the playing field is totally open.\"With a background that includes 10 years of teaching high school biology, Lederman also brings with him a $1.4 million professional development grant for working teachers. At OSU, Lederman struggled to find teachers willing to participate in the program. Providing the final push to leave Corvallis, Oregon, was the diversity in Chicago's student body and in the city as a whole. Diversity is not only healthy for society, Lederman argues, but healthy for learning. 'The street sense and the everyday wiseness of kids growing up in a city brings a lot to the educational environment,' he says.Some of those kids are learning right on IIT's campus, at the(YWLCS). Lederman's spouse and colleague, Judith Sweeney Lederman, will split her time between the new department and a half-time position as science director at the school. Before coming to IIT, Judith Sweeney taught high school science in Providence, Rhode Island, for 20 years and served as curator of education at the city's museum of natural history. She also was a science educator at,, and. The Ledermans have trained educators in international settings all over the globe, including a trip this spring when they conduct workshops and meetings at the University of the North in South Africa.Building a math and science education department at an institute of technology 'is something that is very special, very different and exciting, and appropriate,' Judith Lederman says, describing IIT's new department as being 'unlike any other education department on any other campus' due to the close links with science departments and the opportunity for aspiring teachers to participate in IPROs.The state of affairs in math and science education bothered, Perlstein Distinguished Professor of Engineering, when he started looking for alternatives in 1998. One of Guralnick's favorite sayings is 'You must know a gallon to teach a drop.'Guralnick asked himself the same question as many a science student: How can education majors become good math or science teachers without majoring in these disciplines?Guralnick and several Armour colleagues-, Ed Steuben and others-had incentives to find an answer quickly. Main Campus was about to become the home of the YWLCS, a unique experiment in math and science education for public school girls. Ideally, the teachers would come from IIT. For the last several years, however, the university had supported local schools only through teacher enrichment and technological aid.In addition, retirement loomed for the many teachers who graduated in the '60s and '70s. Chicago Public Schools officials now worry that they may have to replace as many as half of their math and science teachers by 2010. The Department of Education predicts the country will need 2.2 million teachers in the next decade-almost half a million more than expected based on normal turnover. A study by thefound the median age of public and private school teachers to be over five years higher than the average for all workers. Meanwhile, enrollment is expected to increase almost 10 percent in the next 10 years.IIT should train teachers once more, Guralnick's group decided, but without offering a traditional bachelor's degree program in education. Instead, future teachers would graduate with a minor in education and a major in their subject matter, taking many of the same courses as their classmates in science and engineering.The result would be a corps of potential math and science teachers solidly grounded in their subjects. This approach may seem logical, but it remains rare. Over the last few decades, education departments at most colleges and universities have focused increasingly on learning theory and primary education, says Baker.One of the things that happened is the colleges of education across the country became isolated. A wall grew up between the science and education departments. In some cases the education departments began teaching watered-down science and math courses on their own.\"What we have now is not working,\" he says, adding that qualified math and science teachers are scarce in almost all school districts throughout the nation.Paul Vallas, (then-head of Chicago Public Schools), Mayor Richard Daley and the stateadded their enthusiastic support for a new teacher education program, as did the principals of many local schools. The program will stick to its singular mission of preparing excellent math and science teachers for grades 6-12. IIT hopes to attract about 15-20 freshmen per year, along with another 20 students seeking master's-level teacher certification. A doctorate in math or science education also will be offered this fall.For those engineering and science graduates who would like to use their talents for public service, IIT's program will offer a teaching option without removing career choices. Prospective teachers are hard to find, since students who are educated in the sciences have the ability to command a higher salary than is ever offered in primary and secondary education. For this reason IIT's program comes with a pair of financial carrots: Loan forgiveness may be available for some graduates, and the fact that a science or engineering degree carries better income potential than a bachelor's in education.As director of recruitment and substitute services for CPS, Xiomara Cortez Metcalfe has seen many recruits torn between the desire to serve and the need to earn. She calls IIT's program 'fabulous' for its ability to open several career doors simultaneously. 'The beauty is that you walk out with your degree in chemistry and you can also teach,' Metcalfe says.In the public schools near IIT, the gaps in math and science teaching may be filled by graduates and interns from the new program. The university has been working for years to strengthen neighborhood schools: Vallas invited IIT to start a math and science center within, and since 1989, community relations staff have provided teacher support and student enrichment under several grants.The ultimate scenario runs like this: A teacher trained at IIT enters a neighborhood high school, inspiring students from the school to enter IIT, where some will decide to become teachers, return to their neighborhood schools, inspire other students, and so on in an upward spiral of university-community synergy.\"This may be the only technological university in the nation that has made this decision to grow its own, basically,\" Baker says.Makes sense, doesn't it? Yet most technological universities do not support colleges of education, expecting well-prepared freshmen but relying on others to provide the preparation.Says Norman Lederman: 'Engineering and science schools should always have been involved in educating math and science teachers, but for the most part, they haven't. Wow, what an opportunity!'"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2008/letter-president", "content": "What does it take to be a leader in higher education?IIT has embarked on a strategic planning process, Many Voices, One Vision, with the goal of developing the university's unique path to future excellence. Our quest to be recognized as one of the country's top universities is embraced with great pride and a determination to succeed. We can contend for a place among the very best universities by focusing on our strengths in technical and professional education and research, and by leveraging our international diversity and Chicago location.American universities have long held the premier position in higher education across the world. This leadership is eroding, however, because the rest of the world has recognized that education is the foundation of economic and social well-being. Other countries are investing heavily in higher education. The playing field for recruiting students and faculty is increasingly international and more competitive. To stress the latter point, governments of other countries are now providing attractive financial incentives for America's top faculty to be associated with their universities. This trend, coupled with a tightening of U.S. funding for higher education, especially research, has produced challenges for U.S. universities that have not been faced in the past century.Returning to the original question, educational leadership is defined by both the quality and the innovativeness of a university's programs. While many universities have individual towers of excellence, those who are identified as leaders have defined one or more themes across their institution, and have committed themselves to continuous innovation consistent with their mission and vision. In all cases, innovation and commitment are the keys to improvement.Additionally, academic leaders recognize the importance of their students' experiences and continually develop curricula and out-of-classroom programs to better prepare students for their future careers and self-fulfillment. They realize that the graduates are our most important \"product.\" Finally, academic leaders understand that vigorous programs of research and scholarship advance the educational mission while also providing a vehicle for continuous improvement of the faculty.Now is the time for IIT to develop a plan that leverages our strengths, and creates and sustains a university wide culture that embraces bold and transformational ideas. This may seem to be a daunting task, but past planning efforts, such as the National Commission for IIT and the 2010 Plan, have prepared us well to address our current aspirations. As other universities have demonstrated, by strategically focusing on core strengths and building new initiatives with university-wide priority, it is possible to advance from a mid-level, regional university to an academic leader on a regional, national, and global scale.Coordinated by the new Office of Institutional Strategy, the Many Voices, One Vision strategic planning effort will require the contributions of the entire IIT community to determine how to take IIT to the next level. I want to thank the faculty, students, staff, and trustees who have already been called upon to serve on various planning committees, and I welcome the input of all of you. While decisions must be made as we develop our strategies, the key factor in making the right decisions is input from all our constituencies.Through smart choices and collective participation, I know we will shape a successful plan. We must then have the courage to adhere to our plan once it is in place. I ask you to join me in this quest for excellence, and I thank you for your confidence, determination, and continued trust.John L. AndersonPresident"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2011/real-cable-guy", "content": "A few years after World War II ended, Stanley Ciciora used his knowledge gained as a wartime aircraft carrier radio technician to turn his family's FM console radio into a home entertainment center by modifying it to tune in the audio from television channels. In time, he acquired a broken, 12-inch, black-and-white TV and repaired it to the delight of his clan, which included his pre-teen son Walter, who knew that his father had a gift for bringing old TVs, radios, and appliances back to life.\"I have a memory of him waking me up when I was about eight years old to show me a magnetized needle suspended from a string interacting with a magnet; I can't say why, but that stuck with me,\" says Walter Ciciora (EE '64, M.S. '66, Ph.D. '69), via an electronic interview from his home in Southport, Conn. Those early impressions served the young Ciciora well. Now an in-demand expert witness and a recognized contributor in the consumer electronics industry, he literally co-wrote the book on cable television. The first edition ofreceived a book award from The Cable Center in 2000. The second edition was published in 2004.\"Walt Ciciora was one of the brightest students of his time at IIT,\" says Gerald Saletta, professor emeritus in the IIT Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and one of Ciciora's mentors. \"After graduating with his electrical engineering doctorate, he went to work for Zenith with a pack of five guys, all of whom taught at or graduated from IIT. They were a dynamic group that influenced the path of television innovation at Zenith in the United States,\" Saletta says.As an undergraduate, Ciciora first took a summer job at the Zenith Radio Corporation, when cable TV was still in its infancy. Consisting of fewer than 12 analog channels in the form of Community Antenna Television, cable was used primarily by households in remote areas where antenna strength was inadequate. By 1969, when Ciciora graduated from IIT and began working full-time for Zenith, the company shifted its focus to color television. His first project was the digitization of TV signals, which allowed them to be scrambled for an early subscription television service.A watershed event occurred in cable TV on September 30, 1975, when a satellite delivered signals to transmit the \"Thrilla in Manila\" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier on HBO. Concurrently, Ciciora was working to bring Zenith up to speed on the latest data over television developments. He led a team that produced a new data transmission method for use in satellite signals, thus eliminating the use of leased telephone lines to deliver data to cable systems. This move was cost-effective for the company and gave Ciciora an opportunity to transition into the emerging cable set-top box group. With the advent of programming such as CNN and with the number of cable channels steadily growing, a set-top box with expanded tuner range became necessary. With Ciciora's efforts, Zenith sales went from zero to $80 million in two years.One of Ciciora's customers, American Television and Communications, a subsidiary of Time Inc., offered him the position of vice president of its new R & D department. When another watershed cable event occurred in the late 1980s-the formation of a cooperative R & D organization for the entire cable industry-Ciciora's role became one of representing ATC in technical industry affairs and interpreting technology trends.In 1993, Ciciora left ATC (which became Time Warner Cable) to pursue entrepreneurial interests and consultancy opportunities. He co-founded the EnCamera Science Corp. and co-invented a patented technology to embed up to 4.5 megabits/second of data into an analog TV signal without damaging the signal, providing a form of \"over-the-air\" cable. EnCamera was sold to the broadband communications firm Dotcast, Inc., which licensed the technology to The Walt Disney Co. for its MovieBeam service. Rolled out in 29 cities across the country, MovieBeam was an early form of video-on-demand made possible via embedded digital data sent to Disney's ABC network and local PBS stations that then delivered the movies to a set-top box with a hard drive in subscribers' homes.Ciciora also co-founded HBA MatchMaker Media, Inc., a startup that focuses on what many marketers consider to be the Holy Grail of TV advertising-the technical capability to target, deliver, and display specific ads to specific households-and was issued two pioneering patents for \"addressable-advertising\" technologies in the late 1990s. Though the TV industry continues to work on overcoming business issues, such as the ability to feature addressable advertising on a large scale, promise for this latest direction in television is strong. An addressable-advertising test trial done by two media organizations in Baltimore during 2009 showed that viewers turned away from targeted ads 32 percent less of the time than households that received non-targeted ads.While Ciciora-who was named a 2000 Academy of Digital Television Pioneer and a Cable Industry Pioneer-still serves on the board of HBA, he devotes most of his professional life to being an expert witness on legal cases involving interactive TV, cable TV, tuners, electronic program guides, and parental control of TV access. He and his wife, Jeanette, whom Ciciora met at an IIT dance and married in 1964, stay busy traveling, caring for her four horses, and visiting with family, including Ciciora's two brothers, both IIT School of Design alumni, and his four children and seven grandchildren.The electronics technology that made such an indelible impression on Ciciora during his youth continues to evolve and inspire him with its capability to allow his and other families to create lasting memories of their own.\"There are now services that allow free video calls between computers wherever high-speed Internet is available,\" says Ciciora. \"Now children can be told a bedtime story by a parent, no matter where in the world that parent has to travel.\"\"The cable industry has come light years since my student days at IIT in the 1960s,\" says Walter Ciciora, who received Man of the Year awards in 1990 and 1993 frommagazine. He shares his observations on some of the top advances in an industry that began largely as off-air broadcasts and a weather channel consisting of a camera aimed at a set of meteorological instruments.When satellite delivery of TV to cable headends-facilities that produce and distribute TV signals-became affordable, cable TV could be considered for widespread use. \"At around that time, Ted Turner introduced the concept of the 'superstation,'\" adds Ciciora. \"He took his Atlanta UHF station and contracted for it to be delivered nationwide by satellite. Soon after, more and more special-interest channels became available.\"Through improvements in laser technology in the mid 1980s, the trunk component of a neighborhood cable system could be fitted with a fiber optic cable, which allowed dozens of analog TV channels to be launched. \"Suddenly, picture quality got better and reliability dramatically improved,\" says Ciciora. \"Since the trunk of the cable system consisted of only 10 to 20 percent of the total footage, it became relatively inexpensive to put fiber into the trunk and solve some of the most vexing technical problems.\"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the explosive growth of Internet increased the demand for high-speed service. \"Cable could provide more than 10 times the speed of a telephone modem,\" explains Ciciora. \"The phone company responded with DSL service, but it was still slower than cable modems. In the mid-2000s, the cable modem added VoIP (Voice-over Internet Protocol) telephone service. Unlimited calls within the United States for a flat monthly charge of around $30 was a quick winner.\"Academy of Digital Television Pioneers: http://www.ce.org/About-CEA.aspx"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/privacy", "content": "Whether discussing gene patent issues or initiating research on medical apps privacy, Distinguished Professor of Law Lori Andrews has become the country's go-to bioethicist on subjects at the junction of law and medicine.Listen to Lori Andrews, Distinguished Professor of Law, discuss one of her latest privacy initiatives in an IIT Magazine Audio Extra."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2011/probing-beamline", "content": "In the realm of subatomic particle acceleration, rings take centerstage. The world's most powerful proton-antiproton collider in the United States is the circular, located underground at, in Batavia, Ill., while the 27-kilometer-in-circumference, near Geneva, Switzerland, is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator.But rings aren't right for every situation in particle physics, says John Zasadzinski, IIT professor of physics. Colliding electrons produce cleaner data than colliding protons, but electrons lose their speed when bent in a ring by emitting radiation in the form of X-rays and are therefore most optimally collided in a linac, or linear accelerator. And unlike rings, linacs can produce a nearly continuous high-energy stream of particles that can be directed, for example, at a tumor, providing a more targeted mode of destruction than radiation therapy.Zasadzinski, along with Sandra Bishnoi and Brant Cage, assistant professors of chemistry, are members of a global team working on the successor to the Large Hadron Collider, namely, the International Linear Collider, currently under design. Funded by a three-year federal grant through Fermilab and, the three researchers are performing surface-sensitive probe analyses on superconducting radio-frequency cavities, the objects that form the acceleration tunnel through which 20 billion electrons and positrons will zoom to collide at the ILC's center at a rate of 14,000 times per second. Fermilab has discovered that the cavities are breaking down prematurely during trial runs, putting a halt to the acceleration process. The IIT team is also working with Argonne to characterize and determine the properties of protective coatings that could be applied to the cavity surface.\"What we're bringing to the table is something new; these are surface probes that neither Fermilab nor Argonne were using,\" says Zasadzinski, about the team's areas of expertise. Zasadzinski, a condensed-matter physicist, is usingto help learn the quality of the surface of the extremely low-electrical resistant element\u2014niobium\u2014that comprises each of the 16,000 cavities that are expected to line the ILC's two tracks.Throughtesting, Cage is checking the cavity surface for magnetic properties, which will reduce acceleration and lead to sub-optimal speeds. For her contribution, Bishnoi is employing. Among the most sensitive techniques available in surface science, it can identify individual molecules on the surface of a metal.\"There's the possibility that the cavity surface is being contaminated or roughened,\" says Bishnoi. \"Raman can tell us whether or not it's a pure niobium cavity.\"While it's still too early in the project to publish their findings, Zasadzinski says that Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the regions of the cavity where breakdown occurs have pitted surfaces that are entirely different from the rest of the cavity.A fellow of the, Zasadzinski is most fascinated by the juxtaposition of large and small within the ILC itself.\"The proposed accelerator is 19 miles long but what controls how well it works is at the nanometer scale,\" he says. \"We're trying to understand and modify surfaces at 40 nanometers to create an object that will be 31 kilometers long, and get it to work.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2011/letter-president", "content": "\u2014Sir Isaac Newton, letter to Robert Hooke, 1675This famous quote reminds us that our successes are based in good measure on contributions made by those who came before us. As I think about the importance of the university alumni and faculty who preceded us, I think of this quote.IIT has more than 65,000 living alumni throughout the United States and the world. The achievements of our graduates are not only a source of pride for the university, but also a measure of our success in educating those who have made the contributions. While important creations and discoveries have been made at IIT, the dominant contributions to society have been through our graduates. The work of our alumni has led to the invention and development of technologies and products such as the cellular phone, magnetic recording, the first nuclear reactor for industrial research, the Pentium processor, and even electro-optical night vision equipment. However, bragging about these achievements is not enough. For sustained success, IIT needs engaged alumni who promote the university and stay connected.The prominence of a university is as much dependent on alumni support as it is on the accomplishments of current students and faculty. The university has not done a good job of developing engaged alumni. We are committed to changing this. This effort has begun at IIT with a rejuvenated Alumni Board, headed by Trustee Adrian Nemcek (EE '70) and supported by Trustees Andrea Berry (CS '84), Joel Krauss (MATH '71), and Bud Wendorf (ME '71). The agenda of the board includes building relationships and lifelong connections with IIT alumni. We are seeing evidence of this effort through regional receptions, which are being hosted by alumni throughout the country, and a broad, increased alumni interest in the life of our university. Our goals are to build alumni pride, expand and strengthen the alumni network, and connect prospective and current students with alumni.Alumni relations is a clear priority for us.

He says it all began\u2014well, in the beginning\u2014 after IIT was founded following a spirited call to action in the \"Million Dollar Sermon\" of 1890.\"IIT was formed by an entrepreneur, [Philip Danforth] Armour, and I would even say [Frank Wakely] Gunsaulus, who changed careers from preaching at the pulpit to becoming the university's first president,\" says Rokop, managing director of the IIT Stuart School of Business Jules F. Knapp Entrepreneurship Center. \"The way the university grew over the years\u2014from the merger of Armour Institute with the Lewis Institute, and, for example, the addition of the School of Design and Chicago-Kent College of Law\u2014is much like how many entrepreneurs work, bringing in smaller entities to build a large one. Many companies go through this kind of growth to later become a fairly substantial enterprise.\"Rokop's desk is as orderly as are the manila project folders that hold still more organized flowcharts and notes on the many entrepreneurial endeavors taking place at IIT, including one of the newest, the IIT Stuart School of Business Entrepreneurship Academy. Rokop is managing director of the academy, which is under the leadership of Executive Director Harvey Kahalas, IIT Stuart dean.\"The Entrepreneurship Academy is a university-wide initiative designed to advance the spirit and understanding of entrepreneurship across the campus,\" says Kahalas, \"and to promote innovation and excellence as set forth by IIT's Many Voices, One Vision strategic plan. As such, one of our priorities will be to build a formal support system to help students, faculty, and alumni innovate new ideas and successfully take their ideas to the marketplace.\"Plans for the academy, which will unfold over a five-year period, include its role as the umbrella organization for all IIT entrepreneurship organizations and activities, including the Knapp Center; the Kern Innovation and Entrepreneurship Academy (KIEA), a competitive academic/scholarship program for engineering undergraduates; the KnappLab, a mobile phone application facility; student clubs, such as the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Academy, the Undergraduate Business Council, and the Stuart Investment Club; and the IIT Angel Network, an executive-level group of alumni and Chicago business leaders who have made funding commitments to five IIT-connected startups in the last 18 months. The academy is also overseeing the establishment of an expanded entrepreneurship minor and coordinating extracurricular experiential learning opportunities, mentorship programs, and competitions, such as the popular iPhone App Challenge Weekend.The academy will hold some of its activities in the Idea Shop, an expansive physical space designed to foster collaborative idea generation. Located at UTP\u2014home to high-technology startups and established companies, some begun by IIT faculty entrepreneurs [see below sidebar]\u2014the 13,000-square-foot facility provides students with the space and rapid-prototyping equipment to both encourage and assist in a variety of team-based endeavors. Several Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program courses have already been held there, and a prototype of the new IPRO 2.0 format was piloted in the Idea Shop with 100 students during the fall semester.Rokop says that more than 20 courses related to entrepreneurship are currently offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This is in addition to the IPRO courses that have an entrepreneurial slant, called EnPROs, where students have the added challenge of developing an idea for market. Some student EnPRO projects have received outside grants or have served as the launching pad for businesses beyond IIT. Most recently, the EnPRO eMotion, which created a safe method of social networking for \"tween\" girls ages 7-12 with its product, BFF Gemz, became a student-owned company.Students enrolled in Stuart's graduate finance program have the opportunity to hear entrepreneurs present their ideas in a course taught by Ron Kirschner, a former medical practitioner and successful entrepreneur who is the founder and president of Heartland Angels, a prominent Midwest angel investor group. John F. O. Bilson, professor of finance and director of Stuart's finance and mathematical finance programs, says that students learn a broad spectrum of skills that are useful to successful entrepreneurs.\"The students are required to evaluate the proposal based upon such characteristics as ethics, leadership, and creativity, and make a recommendation for funding,\" he explains, noting that this course and another entitled Entrepreneurial Finance provide students with both quantitative and qualitative learning experiences. \"IIT Stuart firmly believes that the two-course combination provides our students with the correct composite of academic excellence and real-world application that is characteristic of the business programs we offer.\"Since 2005, University Technology Park at IIT has provided a haven for startup companies and budding entrepreneurs, especially through its Incubator facility. Because it is part of the university, UTP is able to connect clients with valuable resources at IIT, including services offered through the Knapp Entrepreneurship Center and various types of funding opportunities.Some clients to call UTP home throughout the years did not begin as external clients but rather were already connected with IIT when they joined the park: university faculty members. Four current and former faculty members have been UTP clients since the park opened. Two professors whose companies are currently located within UTP include Miles Wernick and Phil Troyk.Wernick's company, Predictek, Inc., was one of UTP's first clients. Predictek provides neuroimaging data analysis and consulting services, and has developed two products: the IRis\u2122 ophthalmic imaging system (currently being tested clinically) and pipelineMAX\u2122, a neuroimaging data analysis software package.\"IIT encourages faculty to pursue entrepreneurial activities, and UTP provides a great home for small businesses,\" says Wernick, who is Motorola Chair Professor in electrical and computer engineering, and president of Predictek. \"Nik Rokop of the Knapp Center is an energetic supporter of small businesses like mine, providing creative ideas and useful contacts.\" Wernick notes, for example, that Rokop assisted the Predictek team in how best to structure a complicated business deal.Troyk, an associate professor of biomedical engineering, and his company, Sigenics, have been at UTP for the past five years. The company designs and supplies custom integrated circuits for sensor, analog, and mixed-signal applications. Their chips are used in medical and non-medical products. For those with upper limb amputation, Sigenics-designed implantable myoelectric muscle sensors may soon help to restore natural control of robotic prosthetic limbs. Since joining UTP, Sigenics has grown from a startup to a small company with 15 employees.\"Sigenics and IIT greatly benefit from our being near the university,\" explains Troyk. \"All of our engineers are IIT alumni, and some were student interns at Sigenics. UTP provides an environment that helps our growth. Now Sigenics is giving back to IIT through participation in the IPRO Program and joint research projects. The new role of entrepreneurship in higher education is being defined by IIT and UTP. Sigenics is proud to be part of this transformation.\"Another two-course combination, this one offered to first-year engineering students, is demonstrating that entrepreneurship can be taught by igniting the spark known as creativity.\"I don't need to teach creativity as much as I need to accentuate it and inspire; the students already come to class with creativity,\" explains Mark Snyder, Coleman Faculty Fellow and senior lecturer in the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering, about the strategy he uses in his Professional Practice courses, whose themes are creating the student innovator (fall) and creating the engineer entrepreneur (spring).In the course, students delve into the inner workings of entrepreneurship\u2014learning what an entrepreneur is and is not, the myths of entrepreneurship, and the importance of ethics in engineering. Snyder also shows them how to take creativity one step further by adding a value component to their projects. In one course exam, Snyder gives student teams $5 each and instructs them to return to class the next week with more than $5. He says that thus far, the largest sum attained has been $360.Other projects, such as the SEED (Sustainable Entrepreneurship for Economic Development) initiative at Stuart's Center for Strategic Competitiveness, aim to take the benefits of entrepreneurship beyond the academic setting. SEED explores and actively engages with communities across the United States to retain their small-town characteristics while increasing economic attractiveness and vitality through entrepreneurial development, information ubiquity, dramatic technology, and sustainability. For IIT students and alumni, Rokop envisions that the university's breadth of entrepreneurial expertise\u2014reaching from classrooms and labs to the outside community\u2014will benefit them from the time they are in high school through their alumni years. By supplementing college exploratory programs such as Discover Business at Stuart and The Academy for Future Leaders in Science and Technology with an agenda of new entrepreneurial activities, he hopes to show prospective students that IIT offers an environment where good ideas can be developed and supported, and transformed into successful businesses.\"We don't necessarily graduate people who go on to become CEOs of existing Fortune 500 companies; we graduate people who go on to create significant companies,\" Rokop says, citing Edward Kaplan (ME '65), co-founder of Zebra Technologies; Victor Tsao (M.S. CS '80), founder of Linksys; and John P. Calamos Sr. (BE '63, M.B.A. '70), founder of Calamos Asset Management [see sidebar].Alumni from all class years can benefit from IIT's entrepreneurial community by interacting with more experienced alumni who are helping to ensure that IIT's legacy of entrepreneurship continues. In addition to serving in the IIT Angel Network or on the Knapp Board of Advisors, alumni entrepreneurs have provided funding for courses, served as IPRO or EnPRO advisors and judges, and headed competitions featuring new technology. In Snyder's course, two luncheons connecting students and alumni entrepreneurs have taken place and have proven to be popular with both students and alumni.\"My students have discovered that engineering is a vehicle that allows them to do almost anything that they can imagine,\" says Snyder, adding that he could not take credit for what many in his class regarded as being a revelation. \"And they learned that from our alumni.\"From the founding of the university to the new Entrepreneurship Academy, IIT's history is filled with entrepreneurial success stories.

As Victorian gardens fell out of vogue, the pool deteriorated until 1936, when Alfred Caldwell redesigned it and the surrounding area to resemble a river gently coursing though a Midwestern prairie. Located in Chicago's Lincoln Park, the pool is both a National Historic Landmark and a Chicago Landmark.Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Director of the College of Architecture (1938\u20131958)Located on the northeast side of IIT Main Campus, this unassuming building is Mies' only known ecclesiastical structure.

Here are excerpts from each of their speeches."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/son-father", "content": "Timeless advice from a father to a son set in motion events that would benefit both of their lives in more ways than either could have initially imagined.After a successful career as a computer engineer, John Maly entered law school to specialize in patent work and intellectual property law but was contemplating leaving the program. He approached his father, James, for advice.\"I told him not to because I felt that he would regret his decision then and also in the future,\" says Maly Sr.John Maly did go on to become a successful attorney and took his father's words to heart in an even deeper way. Last fall he sent a letter to IIT administrators inquiring about the possibility of the university awarding his father an honorary degree in mechanical engineering based on Maly's career contributions in the field of food science. A panel composed of Christopher White, vice provost of academic affairs and professor of physics along with three other academic leaders, did one better. Noting that Maly was only four credit-hours short of attaining his undergraduate degree, the team developed a plan that allowed him to complete the final requirements for a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and welcomed him as a member of the IIT Class of 2014\u201315.\"My dad finishing his degree at the age of 83 is testament to the power of his own advice: Never give up on your dreams, no matter how long it takes you!\" his son said via an email message.Unable to attend Commencement ceremony on May 16 because of health restrictions, James Maly recalled his life and career path by phone from his home in Oro Valley, Arizona.A Chicago native and United States Army veteran, Maly was drafted before he was able to complete his final four credit-hours at IIT. What Maly lacked in degree requirements, however, he made up for in experience, working as a mechanical engineer for more than four decades. After being employed for a short time at U.S. Steel Corporation and Koppers Company, Maly broke into the food industry. He picked up experience at Campbell Soup Company then went up the corporate ladder in engineering management at Beech-Nut Food Corporation, H. J. Heinz Company, and General Foods Corporation/Kraft before retiring in 1992. Along the way he worked to develop two technologies still in use today\u2014a method for processing and packaging aseptically processed, all-natural dairy-based sauces and what came to be known as Kool Burst packaging for drink-bottle design.\"While I was more interested in making things better, the Kool Burst packaging was a new technology for that type of product,\" Maly explains.To determine if Maly could be given academic credit for his experience, White requested that he prepare papers on his two inventions/developments, summarizing the significance of the patents he received as well as his role in and contributions to each project.\"I asked Robert Brackett [director of the IIT Institute for Food Safety and Health] and Keith Bowman [chair of the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering] to review the papers to tell me if the work described was worthy of course credit in the form of independent study,\" says White, noting that both readily agreed that Maly's technical skills alone deserved merit. \"So Mr. Maly was awarded credit for two (two-hour) independent study courses.That James Maly received his degree more than 60 years after he attended IIT adds a uniquely special quality to a momentous occasion in the life of a college student. It also provides a touching object lesson.\"In class, I remind my students that there are many solutions to any problem and while there may be one primary solution, others do exist,\" explains White. \"The same is true for completing a degree program.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/cool-hidden-places-iit-main-campus", "content": "While the peacocks of IIT's Mies Campus\u2014S. R. Crown Hall, The McCormick Tribune Campus Center/Exelon Tube, and State Street Village, to name a few\u2014may command center stage, there are many less-showy places that are attention-grabbing in their own right. Heading south from the campus's northwest corner across from Stuart Field, here are eight you can become acquainted with\u2014at least online.Once part of a three-building complex that comprised the research center of the Association of American Railroads, this building now serves as a storage depot for the IIT Department of Facilities and Maintenance Management. To help keep Main Campus roads and paths clear over winter 2014\u201315, Facilities unloaded more than 100 tons of rock salt in the building.Last year VanderCook College of Music completed the first phase of a renovation plan that added space to rehearsal areas, ensemble rooms, and practice/teaching studios used for private lessons, individual practice, and small chamber ensemble rehearsal.The IIT Department of Facilities and Maintenance Management as well as the Office of Sustainability are located in one of the earliest-constructed (1901) buildings on Main Campus, Machinery Hall, designed by the architectural firm of Patton & Fisher. A Chicago Landmark, Machinery Hall was the first Armour Institute building completed in the twentieth century.A 1.4-megawatt rooftop smart solar photovoltaic array at Siegel Hall is just one of more than 15 installations in various stages of completion across IIT Main Campus as part of the Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation microgrid project.Located in the lower level of Paul V. Galvin Library, the IIT Archives features about 4,000 linear feet (shelf space) of processed materials. There are more than 1,000 catalogued collections\u2014and nearly 1,000 linear feet of materials awaiting processing.Established in 1853 as a small liberal-arts institution, Shimer College has been a part of IIT's Main Campus since 2006, when the school relocated from Waukegan, Ill. Its curriculum is based entirely on primary sources from the classics and contemporary masters.Built to generate steam and electricity, IIT's co-generation plant was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and first began producing energy on May 23, 1991. The plant is now looped into the Main Campus microgrid project.A portion of the lower level of the 3424 S. State Street building housed the first industrial nuclear reactor, which went into use on June 28, 1956. Nicknamed \"the atomic furnace,\" the reactor produced short-lived radioisotopes for a variety of projects until it was decommissioned in the mid-1970s."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/plain-sight", "content": "You say that you've walked through IIT Main Campus for years but have never heard of the Galvin-Pritzker Grove?

Footlik (ME '39) and his wife, Sylvia, this north-south path runs through Main Campus from 31st Street to 35th Street. Along the way are several points of interest such as The Rock, a likely candidate for Chicago's smallest public park, and bold displays of public art.Originally part of an exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, The Rock was given to Armour Institute and had its first campus home in front of Armour Mission. It was then moved to its present location at the southeast corner of Hermann Hall. A smaller rock can be found outside of S. R. Crown Hall. Is it a chip off the old Rock? No one seems to know for sure\u2026As members of the IIT community we all may feel a little possessive about sculptor George Segal's(1986), but we'll need to get over that, pronto. Why? Because the Chicago Park District has designated the sculpture as Park No. 474. While it's described as being \"perhaps the smallest park in the district,\" we'll still need to share its 6'x9' expanse with the entire city.Outdoor public art can also be found in front of three buildings along Footlik Lane:The red-orange, a series of beams stacked horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, is on the lawn north of Alumni Hall. It is a teaching aid commissioned by the American Institute of Steel Construction.To support the quant-driven programs of Stuart School of Business in its new IIT Tower location, two computer labs opened in fall 2014 that feature equipment and software exclusive to Stuart. While the lab is largely used for financial strategy development and implementation, the space has also been used to run trading simulations for visiting high school students and to showcase research.This illuminated tabletop model of the IIT microgrid is on display at the Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation on the 16th floor of IIT Tower. The colors signify the specific microgrid loops at IIT. Developed by the Galvin Center as part of the U.S. Department of Energy-funded IIT Perfect Power project, the IIT microgrid is the first campuswide microgrid in the United States.IIT's own student-operated radio station broadcasts from The McCormick Tribune Campus Center seven days a week. At 88.9 on the FM band andon the Web, WIIT features a variety of programs ranging from jazz to indie rock to talk. In 2010 the studio was renamed as the A. Sidney Katz Radio Studio in recognition of Katz, a 1962 electrical engineering alumnus and attorney, who was a WIIT deejay during his student days.The concept of developing a campus-scale urban farm connecting students to sustainably produced food sources began in 2011 as an Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course. Three years later, the student organization UFarmIIT took over the project. The farm, located in IIT's Greek quad, produces a variety of produce and even flowers during the summer growing season.Established in 2003, the Galvin-Pritzker Grove, located on the southwest corner of 33rd Street and State Street, honors the two \"Bobs\"\u2014Robert A.

Rus came to IIT in 2014 from the University of Chicago, where he served as associate director of alumni relations and development. Before that he was a fundraising consultant at Pennington & Company and director of education programs at Sigma Alpha Epsilon.In his role at Illinois Tech, Rus hopes to show alumni the importance of keeping connected to their alma mater.\"I want alumni to know they can come back to the university for anything,\" he says. \"If they move, they can reach out to local volunteer leaders with questions about the area. If they're looking for a job, they should think of the Alumni Association as the first place to go for support. If they're simply looking to have fun and connect with other alumni, they can host a chapter event.\"Rus also hopes to build bridges between alumni and students.\"Current students should look to alumni for advice, and I can help connect alumni to those students. Ultimately, I want all alumni and students\u2014who are future alumni\u2014to know that their connection to IIT doesn't end after they cross the stage during Commencement,\" he says.At his own alma mater, Simpson College, in Iowa, Rus sets the bar for involved alumni.\"I attend all their Chicago events and keep in contact with their alumni relations and development offices,\" he says. \"I follow their athletic teams and find myself getting too worked up over a loss to one of our rivals!\"When he's not traveling or attending alumni events, Rus enjoys spending time with friends and family.

Festooned with alloy shavings and outfitted with a series of hydraulic levers and hand-cranks, the 1939 Monarch lathe\u2014\"the first contour cutting machine in the world\" according to the Monarch Machine Tool Company\u2014might intimidate most individuals, but not metal master Craig Johnson, head of the Armour College of Engineering Machine Shop and coordinator of the Student Fabrication and Design Studio. In fact, you could say that the lathe is his pride and joy.\"It came from the Navy and somehow helped to fight World War II,\" Johnson explains, acknowledging the years that IIT was involved in the V-12 Navy College Training Program. \"The lathe is still sought after today. The bearings alone would sell for $18,000 each; the machine has appreciated over time. It's hard to find decent manual machine tools nowadays. They really have no place in a production shop anymore; you would lose money by the buckets if you tried to make parts with it in quantity. But for prototyping shops or machine repair shops, something like this lathe is invaluable.\"The Monarch is just one of the many tools in Johnson's kingdom of clink and clank. For nearly 26 years, IIT internal and external clients have tapped his artistic acumen to design and craft parts. These include everything from tiny titanium neurotransmitters for IIT Biomedical Engineering Professor Philip Troyk's intracortical visual prosthesis project to metal connectors used in the ill-fated globe-circling balloon flight attempted by Kevin Uliassi (ARCH '90) in 2000.\"Some of our parts flew to Burma and are now in the National Air and Space Museum,\" says Johnson with a bemused smile, as he picks up a lightweight silver-colored object that looks like a miniature playground slide. \"I don't know a lot about drag racing, but apparently John Force is a name to be reckoned with and came to the shop a number of years ago because he wanted some work done on a car. This is a scale model of the wing that was on the back of his dragster; he wanted to optimize the performance of that. This was then mounted in one of IIT's wind tunnels. Air was blown across it; we could change the angles of attack so that when it came to running the wing on the real car, it simplified and shortened the time needed to get the car running the way Force's team wanted it to run.\"When Johnson and three other machinists staffed Armour's Professional Shop, it was known as the go-to place for developing models, with various external clients including other academic institutions across the country and companies such as Boeing. Johnson now devotes his time fully to IIT and helping to keep the university's wind tunnels in business.\"It is indispensable to have someone with his experience,\" says David R. Williams, wind tunnel researcher and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, who served as the shop's faculty supervisor from 2000\u20132010. \"Craig almost always has a way of making the original idea better by taking a different approach, whether by simplifying the manufacturing process or utilizing a completely different idea. If we didn't have that shop my research would easily be cut in half. I propose to do things knowing that I have this type of backup. Indirectly, he makes it possible for us to bring in our research grants and be competitive with other universities.\"Hailing from a long line of carpenters, machinists, and jewelers, Johnson had his own watch repair business before coming to IIT and began to develop his artisanship in the sixth grade, when his father bought him a home metal lathe. One of his first projects for Armour was helping to complete the construction of the National Diagnostic Facility wind tunnel. He is now looking forward to working more with Armour students as plans unfold to expand the Professional Shop's offerings in the John T. Rettaliata Engineering Center (formerly Engineering 1).Currently, Armour students can make objects in three different places within the facility: the Student Fabrication and Design Studio, a new open laboratory outfitted with rapid-prototyping machines, laser printers, small hand tools, and plenty of white board space for work on simple class projects; the Student Shop headed by Oscar \"Stan\" Johnson (no relation to Craig Johnson), where they learn safety basics and fabricate simple metalworking projects; and the Professional Shop, where students now have access to only one precision-cutting machine. The college is planning to open a wider area of the shop to students, who will receive further instruction from Johnson on completing advanced projects.Johnson says that collaborating with students and faculty ranks right up there with coaxing precisely crafted pieces from his computer numerical control machines and old-school lathes.\"I very much enjoy looking at an idea or a sketch from students or faculty, working with them to create a final CAD [computer-aided design] model, and then going from that to a physical thing that becomes a useful piece of equipment that could help make a new contribution to science,\" he says."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/airflow-art", "content": "A billow of smoke within an IIT wind tunnel transforms into a unique work of art under the creative guidance of IIT Professor Candace Wark and colleague Shirley Nannini.At first glance, most viewers assume the fluid-like images originated from a computer. So when Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Candace Wark and her art colleague Shirley Nannini explain how they produce their photographs using a wind tunnel, the typical reaction is pure amazement.\"People are usually surprised and very impressed,\" says Wark. \"They say something like, 'Wow! What a creative process.'\"Blending science and art, the images reveal the beauty of airflow patterns captured using smoke, light, and colored filters. To visualize the movement of invisible air, Wark and Nannini introduce smoke into the wind tunnel by coating a wire with oil and running an electric current through it. As the oil burns, the smoke gets carried by the air flowing through the tunnel. It passes around and over objects placed in the tunnel, such as tennis balls or flat plates, and then the women photograph the patterns produced downstream. The images' brilliant colors arise from filters placed over the lights used to illuminate the smoke.\"We work with the lighting, the speed, and various conditions in the wind tunnel until we get these images that people really respond to. For 25 years I've been doing scientific photography of flow patterns and they've always looked beautiful to me, but until Shirley, I had never thought of them as art.\"The two women met on a tennis court in 2003 and later explored airflow art in 2012 as part of a project for one of Nannini's photography classes.\"I still have the first image we took and it's so crude, yet in it I could see the beginning of something that could be very exciting,\" says Nannini, who trained in photography after retiring from a 30-year teaching career. \"Candace brought a wealth of knowledge from her scientific background and research, but she had never applied it to an artistic venue. So it was a learning process for us both. We explored every idea we had to see where it took us.\"Captivated by their early results, the two continued to experiment until they had captured images that they considered art worthy. Next, they applied to local art exhibits.The duo's first airflow art exhibit went on display in 2012 at the 737 North Michigan building in Chicago. Since then, their work has appeared in more than 25 exhibits, including a recent exhibition at Willis Tower in downtown Chicago.Their work and upcoming exhibit schedule can be viewed at"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/reaping-research-wind", "content": "Chicago seems a natural choice for airflow studies. Yet Illinois Institute of Technology's renown for aerodynamics research resulted not from its geographic location but rather the dedication of its faculty, students, and supporters.Pioneering work done in the 1960s by engineering professors Mark V.\u00a0 Morkovin and Andrew Fejer contributed significantly to the field. Morkovin furthered the understanding of instability, transition, and turbulence, and the relevance of fluid dynamics to the aerospace industry. Two key projects to which he contributed\u2014the first transonic and supersonic airplane (the) and the first maneuverable re-entry vehicle\u2014are displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.Fejer's achievements in wind tunnel design and research helped to advance jet engine propulsion, helicopter flight, and wind engineering.In 1985 Illinois Tech established the Fluid Dynamics Research Center (FDRC) to forward the work begun by Morkovin and Fejer. Hassan M. Nagib (MAE '68, M.S. '69, Ph.D. '72), John T. Rettaliata Endowed Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, served as the center's founding director and also helped to design and secure funding for the National Diagnostic Facility, one of the nation's largest academic wind tunnels.Under Nagib's leadership, the FDRC was chosen as one of three National Centers of Excellence by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research.Today the FDRC houses several water channels and wind tunnels, including the Mark V. Morkovin Wind Tunnel, the Andrew Fejer Unsteady Wind Tunnel, and the National Diagnostic Facility (not currently in use). Illinois Tech faculty and students from around the globe conduct research at the FDRC for projects ranging from efforts to reduce drag on commercial planes to developing airflow controls for combat aircraft.Through their work, the university's contributions to defense and civil technologies tap into a variety of applications.

The presentation on the IIT Computer Discovery Camp for Middle School Girls already proved to be valuable to Parent U participant Sally Wall. Her granddaughter, Cassidy, was accepted into the camp being held on Main Campus this summer\"The information that I received at Parent University was very inspiring. I learned how to navigate between the different programs and how to apply for financial aid. I also found out about the summer camp at IIT,\" says Wall. \"When Cassidy found out that it was a technology camp she told me, 'Grandma, I'm going to love that!'\"Young introduced a new dimension to Parent U, to be held four times a year, at the June 20 session. Parents were welcome to bring along young children to participate in Kids' Corner, where graduate students introduced the kids to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) concepts via fun activities using LEGOs, robotics, and more. With children of various ages benefiting from Parent U, Young hopes to bring the program full circle by one day providing parents with their own opportunity to complete a college education that they may have put on hold, perhaps to raise a family."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/sailing-science", "content": "A firm grasp of aerodynamics allows you to understand what's happening when wind passes over and around a boat's sail, yet provides little strategic edge in a yacht race.

That raw space inspired me beyond belief,\" says high school junior Ryan Sander, referring to a new Evanston, Ill., facility where kids can learn\u2014and in the process learn more about who they really are. \"I was able to explore a certain level of creativity that I had never accessed before.\"A former warehouse-turned-furniture showroom before its latest incarnation as Hackstudio, the building, at 16,000 square feet, gave Sander, who choreographed a hip-hop dance, plenty of room to flex his muscles, especially his creative one. In May, he and 18 other youngsters, ages 8\u201318, completed a four-month beta program at the studio co-founded by Michael \"Mike\" Meiners (M.Arch. '00).\"Hackstudio is a place for kids to learn how to succeed by being who they are,\" says the enthusiastic Meiners, who recalls that as a kid he always had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. \"The program is made to draw out the things that matter deeply to each child. We move the kids into projects of their own design that they define clearly with the help of mentors and peers. The program is also designed to move kids into moments of struggle, but in that process they build their identity.\"Four years ago Meiners, father to two sons, established a 45-minute \"project time\" session one evening each week at home with his children. He says that the sessions have grown into Hackstudio, where his sons, 11 and 12, now work on their projects.\"School is necessary; school is valuable,\" Meiners explains. \"But kids need the opportunity to explore the things that have deep meaning. The realities of scheduling and responsibilities make it difficult to carve out time to do this. Hackstudio is a way for kids to have that exploration time.\"Along with business partners Randy Blaugh and Katy Bradford, Meiners will open Hackstudio to the public in September. Kids will attend a weekly two-hour session over a quarter term and after choosing their projects will work with peers and mentors to get them done. Mentors, however, will only step in when kids face a moment of real struggle. That key policy proved to be especially valuable to at least one beta participant.\"At Hackstudio I learned life skills that will be applicable in everything I do in the future,\" says Sander, \"such as having the ability to persevere until something is absolutely finished and seeing things through to the end.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/one-kind", "content": "In this city of many architectural gems, the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship truly will be one of a kind\u2014in both design and its ability to bring together programs and people at IIT.Design architect John Ronan and his team have drawn plans for this new building, a 92,000-square-foot, three-level facility that respects IIT's architectural heritage while allowing for spaces and concepts that will define the university's future.In what will be a first in Chicago, the exterior window system of the upper level of the Kaplan Institute will be made of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) film. This low-maintenance, highly durable, energy-efficient material is translucent, allowing natural light to enter the building and giving the building a glow at night. Solar energy entering the building can be controlled through sophisticated pneumatics. Some notable examples of the use of ETFE include the \"Water Cube\" swimming pool complex in Beijing, Allianz Arena in Munich, and the Eden Project in Cornwall, United Kingdom.Plans for the Kaplan Institute include numerous outdoor elements woven into the interior, including two open courtyards and terraces. These spaces will become alternative study, classroom, and collaboration areas, giving the building a much larger impact. Flexibility will be key. Adaptable studio and classroom spaces will allow users to create a variety of learning environments on demand via deployable walls and furniture. These variable spaces, changeable classrooms, and technological advances allow for a constant evolution of the educational environment.The Kaplan Institute will bring together much of IIT's signature programming under one roof, including IIT Institute of Design, the Idea Shop\u2122, the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program, Jules F.

Now online retailers want to deliver your packages using drones.Sounds simple enough, especially if the lightweight, unmanned vehicles have to zip over rural areas only. Yet once they hit a city like Chicago, turbulent wind forces could deplete their power supplies and send them spiraling off course.That's why drone designers look to researchers such as Candace Wark (Ph.D. MAE '88), IIT professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, whose fundamental airflow research can inform ways to program drones to better navigate urban environments.\"We know quite a bit about atmospheric flow in general, so we have an idea of what to expect in terms of the wind gust levels above Iowa farmland. But when that airflow makes its way into a city, the interaction between the wind and the buildings creates a very complicated flow problem,\" Wark says.Walk downtown in any major city and you'll experience the familiar gusts that travel down the sides of tall buildings and through the intersections. For the past 25 years\u2014including her early days as a Ph.D. candidate\u2014Wark has worked in the Mark V. Morkovin Wind Tunnel studying the unique dynamics of these urban airflow patterns. Her research has revealed some surprising results that highlight their complexity.Professor Candace Wark explains why IIT's Mark V. Morkovin Wind Tunnel is her go-to tool for studying airflow patterns over cities such as Chicago.\"In looking at a city like Chicago, if the wind flow is coming directly out of the west and then shifts to the north or the south by just five degrees, that can drastically change the flow patterns throughout the downtown area,\" she says. \"I didn't expect it to be that large of a change for that small of an angle.\"Understanding and building models to predict these complex airflow patterns could allow drone designers to develop navigational systems that map the best routes through a city given the variables of a particular day. Other applications include charting the dispersion of air pollution or the potential flow of contaminants introduced accidentally, or intentionally, into the air above or around an urban environment.So how do you study something invisible, such as wind? For starters, you contain it in a tunnel where you can manipulate, measure, and map its currents.Wark and her students set up models\u2014such as rows of Plexiglas blocks\u2014in the Morkovin tunnel's test section to simulate an urban environment, and then use lasers and cameras to capture the movement of aerosol particles at various wind speeds through the mock urban array. Airflow patterns can also be visualized by introducing smoke into the tunnel via a technique that involves sending an electric current through an oil-slicked wire. The latter method is one Wark uses to create artistic images of flow patterns [see], which recently were featured in an exhibit at Willis Tower in Chicago.Data collected from Wark's wind tunnel experiments flows to Dietmar Rempfer, IIT professor of applied mathematics/mechanical and aerospace engineering, who uses it to build predictive models that one day may help drones navigate the windiest of cities."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/soaring-above", "content": "of World War II\u2014where the best pilots and planes won battles\u2014and then consider the modern need for a well-maneuvered fighter jet.Now imagine what happens when technology exceeds the limits of the human body and pilots can no longer endure the rigors of strategic aerial moves. The choice to remove that person from the cockpit seems inevitable.\"I firmly believe that the days of manned combat aircraft are numbered,\" says Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering David R. Williams, director of the IIT Fluid Dynamics Research Center. \"If you remove the pilot, then that airplane becomes less expensive and much more maneuverable. And the plane that can outmaneuver an opponent in a combat situation wins.\"For example, F-16 pilots can withstand a 6 gravitational-force turn for short bursts with the help of special equipment that keeps them from losing consciousness. Pitted against an unmanned craft that can pull off a 9 g-force turn, however, they will be outmaneuvered and likely lose an aerial fight.Leading United States defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing are already building unmanned combat aircraft on a large scale, and BAE Systems (United Kingdom) and Dassault Aviation (France) boast similar projects. Without a human onboard, these aircraft require no cockpits or environmental controls for pressure or oxygen. Instead they can be designed so that their \"pilots\" remain on the ground and operate them from a remote terminal.Learn about the aerodynamics research that Professor David R. Williams and his students are exploring in the IIT Supersonic Wind Tunnel.Williams and students working in IIT's Andrew Fejer Unsteady Wind Tunnel and Supersonic Wind Tunnel are exploring how to build these aircraft so that they have the desired extra maneuverability.\"If you're going to do these very rapid and extreme maneuvers, you've got to be able to predict the aerodynamic forces accurately\u2014and you need to be able to control them,\" says Williams.The Fejer Tunnel has the ability to simulate unsteady aerodynamics\u2014namely the gusts and drops in wind\u2014that affect flight. By placing model aircraft wings in the tunnel's test section, students can apply different airflow conditions, collect vital data on the variables, and then study how to adjust the airflow over the wing to maintain control of the plane.In the Supersonic Tunnel, they are studying what happens to airflow over the wing during high angles (up to 20 degrees) of attack. \"Control surfaces such as the elevators and ailerons don't work well at high angles of attack, so we're using the tunnel to research other ways to exert control. There are different techniques, but right now we're using small slots where jets of air come out of the wing at critical locations and change the flow pattern over the wing to adjust the lift or drag forces on it.\"Sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the work supports a NATO Applied Vehicle Technology group, and serves as preliminary research for a larger-scale project to be conducted this summer at the U.S. Air Force Academy.Williams's aerodynamics research and the lure of working in the Fejer and Supersonic tunnels have drawn students from around the globe. \"We have a student from Berlin working here on his master's thesis and several IIT undergrads, along with graduate students from Princeton, who are using the tunnels to support their Ph.D. work,\" Williams says. \"We also have a collaboration with Cal Tech and UCLA, and each summer we get at least one intern from the University of Poitiers in France. So there are many connections occurring with these projects.\"Thanks to technology, we can remove people from the cockpit while still valuing the benefits of them working together on the ground."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/commencement-2014-15", "content": "President John L.

It was the heart of \"The Stroll,\" a vibrant cultural center of African-American nightlife that for a time reigned as America's jazz capital. During the day, the larger neighborhood comprising \"The Stroll\"\u2014Bronzeville\u2014was a thriving and largely self-sufficient community anchored by churches and successful businesses such as Binga Bank, the city's first African-American-owned bank, which was known as the \"Wall Street\" of the South Side.Just to the west of 33rd and State, a forerunner of a different sort was quietly rising: Armour Institute of Technology, created in 1890 out of the Armour Mission by the Reverend Frank Gunsaulus, a man of faith, and Philip Danforth Armour Sr., a giant of industry. When Bronzeville was laying roots as a new Chicago community, Armour Institute had already graduated its first African-American chemical engineer and by all accounts, the first African-American in the country to receive a chemical engineering degree, Charles W. Pierce, who left his home in Texas to seek new opportunities in Chicago. How would this progressive school continue to form partnerships with residents of the new Bronzeville community?Bridge building projects across the Chicago River as well as increased use of the automobile opened up new areas on the city's West Side and North Side, where people could now live and raise their families. The nineteenth-century wood-framed houses that dotted the South Side were in poor condition, and the big Victorian mansions that once were the homes to wealthy industrialists were now either abandoned or divided into apartments.During World War I, fewer laborers came to the United States from Europe, and for this reason industrialists looked to the South for workers; at the same time, African Americans were leaving the South to seek opportunities in other regions of the country. Good rail connections between the Mississippi Delta communities and Chicago\u2014the nation's transportation hub\u2014helped to create what came to be known as the Great Migration. According to the City of Chicago, the city's African-American population grew nearly 150 percent from 1910 to 1920, reaching a population of 110,000 by 1920. The early 1920s marked a peak period in the history of Bronzeville, with community members making strides not only in music but also in the areas of politics, entrepreneurship, and business.The trajectories of Bronzeville and its neighboring urban institution of higher education, however, soon changed sharply; the former began to spiral downward as the latter continued to expand and move forward.Beginning in the 1940s, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) had begun erecting \"residential towers\" in primarily African-American neighborhoods throughout the city. This was a public-policy extension of racially restrictive covenants, which were in place from 1927 to 1948, and continued to limit African Americans in moving into other neighborhoods. Additionally, the police wereparticipating in selective enforcement of illicit activities and this, combined with economic segregation, further contributed to a living environment in Bronzeville in which both crime and poverty flourished.Changes in such public policy fostered disenfranchisement and isolation among African Americans on the South Side. One notable example of this decline in Bronzeville housing was the once-vibrant Mecca Flats, which stood on the site of S. R. Crown Hall. Built in 1891, the Mecca was considered the epitome of a great apartment residence and attracted residents who reveled in its luxurious touches. By the 1920s it was a dilapidated tenement, its residents unable to move in part due to restrictive covenants and the economic devastation of the Great Depression.Beginning in the late 1940s, Armour Institute, incorporated as Illinois Institute of Technology, razed buildings that were once the home to Bronzeville residents and businesses to expand the campus per Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's master plan. Mecca Flats, one of the last to fall, was razed in 1952. Why didn't Bronzeville's residents turn against IIT when the university purchased large parcels of land in the community?University Archivist Ralph Pugh, who also teaches courses in Chicago history at IIT, says that there are several reasons why the university and Bronzeville survived this seminal period.\"Historic preservation was not foremost in the community's mind,\" he explains. \"The African-American middle class and civic leaders left the area as soon as they could. Getting out of sub-standard housing was the goal of those who were left behind in these tenements. The center of Bronzeville had also moved away from IIT\u2014slid past it from 35th and State to 47th Street. So in a sense, IIT was razing buildings and developing land no one in the community felt passionately about claiming.\"The period from the mid-1940s through the 1950s marked a golden age of growth and expansion for Main Campus from seven acres to 110 acres in part through the efforts of the South Side Planning Board, whose objective was to help revitalize and stabilize a seven-square-mile area that included Bronzeville. Board members included IIT and Michael Reese Hospital. Also, enforcing the power of eminent domain, the City of Chicago razed hundreds of buildings to construct the Dan Ryan Expressway. This latest effort at urban renewal and public works construction was a difficult time for many Bronzeville residents, however, who were relocated to Stateway Gardens and then to Robert Taylor Homes, the then-new CHA residential towers.In the late 1960s, after the death of Martin Luther King Jr., many universities located in or close to predominantly African-American communities started looking for ways to strengthen relationships with area residents and businesses with the goal of providing better campus environments for their students. Illinois Tech began to expand educational opportunities for underrepresented students across the city with novel initiatives such as the Early Identification Program and the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers Program (CAHMCP, known as \"Champs.\")\"IIT benefited greatly during this time from the efforts of Nate Thomas, John Bradley, and Dr. Regnal 'Reggie' Jones,\" says Leroy Kennedy, vice president of IIT's Office of Community Affairs and Outreach Programs. \"Thomas was instrumental in recruiting African Americans from across the country who wanted to earn engineering degrees to enroll in IIT. In the 1980s, Jones and Bradley, through Champs, which was housed at IIT, encouraged and mentored qualified African-American students to study pre-med in college and then apply for admission to medical school.\"A native South Sider and long-time community activist, Kennedy joined IIT in 1989. As one of his first outreach efforts he helped to organize the Mid-South Planning Group, a community initiative composed of foundation, corporate, civic, and government partners. The group developed the \"Mid-South Strategic Development Plan: Restoring Bronzeville,\" a blueprint for land use in Bronzeville for the next 20 years. As a result, the Mid-South Planning and Development Commission was formed to help implement the plan's recommendations\u2014a key one being a \"better integration of IIT into the neighborhood.\"IIT took other lead roles in creating new coalitions designed to strengthen a sense of community. Kennedy became involved in the South Side Partnership, for example, helping to strengthen and unify community and institutional interests. The group worked to support local educational improvements and was instrumental in connecting South Side communities to the resources of the partner organizations that were interested in serving the area, which included IIT, the Chicago Urban League, Centers for New Horizons, and others.During the 1990s and 2000s, changes took place to help rebuild Bronzeville. The university worked with the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago to sponsor the country's first urban Parade of Homes, proving that market-rate housing was viable and profitable in Bronzeville.The collaborative Black Metropolis Historic District initiative focused on the historic preservation of remaining Bronzeville structures and heritage tourism to drive economic development, a strategy that complemented IIT's intentions to upgrade campus buildings and their landscape. The initiative was a public-private partnership whose membership included local civic and government leaders as well as university representatives. Kennedy has also worked to have a large span of area including Bronzeville designated as a National Heritage Area and is in the final stage of talks with the National Park Service on this potential designation.By 2000 construction was completed on the new headquarters of the Chicago Police Department\u2014the most technologically advanced police facility in the country\u2014now located at the corner of 35th and Michigan Avenue. During this same period, the CHA's Stateway Gardens public housing high-rises located at 35th and State were being demolished; by 2007 they were replaced with Park Boulevard, a mixed-income housing and business development, complete with a Starbucks coffee shop. IIT worked with the City of Chicago and the CHA in the early stages of the Plan for Transformation, an initiative to redevelop the city's public housing beginning in 2000.Leroy Kennedy, vice president for the IIT Office of Public Affairs and Outreach Programs, discusses the development of the Park Boulevard housing complex\u2014site of the former Stateway Gardens\u2014in a video courtesy of the Chicago Housing Authority.IIT also partnered with Perspectives Charter Schools to open Perspectives/IIT Math & Science Academy, a STEM-focused middle school and high school, at 36th and Wabash in 2008. The newest community outreach program is Parent University [see sidebar], which is designed to guide parents and guardians of middle and high school students through the college preparatory and admission process.IIT continues to seek ways to provide educational opportunities for residents of Bronzeville and the greater South Side community, but collaborative work still needs to be done in other areas as well, such as finding ways to reduce crime, further revitalize commercial development, and create more jobs for locally, minority-, and women-owned businesses.\"The attitudes and actions that can limit progress and destroy these hard-won gains or weaken our sense of shared community are retrenchment, isolation, an attitude that all is well, and lack of engagement\u2014economic, academic, social, and cultural as well as philosophical,\" says Kennedy. \"An active citizenry creates a balanced growth environment and is accountable. The environment is not defined or based on race, economics, political partisanship, or cultural identity, but on a shared sense of community based on enlightened self-interest. That is the path IIT and Bronzeville need to keep walking\u2014and we need to keep walking it together.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2015/mapping-history", "content": "Look at a map and you'll see the physical.

'42). Boder spent two months collecting firsthand accounts from Jews and non-Jews of all ages, nationalities, and stations of life.Prior to his death in 1961, Boder translated and transcribed many of the interviews. He included eight of them in his 1949 bookand later self-published 70 more in the series(16-volume set published from 1950 to 1957).He had also contacted relatives of his interview subjects and, where possible, arranged for them to hear the recordings of their loved ones recounting what they had experienced.\"One of the most extraordinary aspects of the recordings is the extent to which Dr. Boder focused on the day-to-day events in people's lives, which, when woven together, create a rich and detailed picture of the impact of war and Nazi Germany,\" says M. Ellen Mitchell, Illinois Tech psychology professor, former dean of the College of Psychology, and former interim dean of Lewis College of Human Sciences. In 1998 Mitchell discovered the recordings and the 16-volume set of interview transcripts in the archives of IIT's Paul V. Galvin Library. \"As a collection, they are a priceless oral history rooted in real events,\" she notes.Mitchell and several colleagues secured funds to preserve the collection for future generations via an online project,. Library staff volunteered their time to input the transcripts for online use. Other work included digital transcoding and cleanup of the audio recordings, which can be heard on the Voices website, as well as translation of non-English transcripts, and website development.IIT also partnered with the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie to create an exhibit honoring Boder's work. Items on permanent loan to the museum include Boder's 1946 audio recordings, his photograph, a signed copy of his 1949 book, and a wire recorder.Boder was posthumously inducted into the Illinois Tech Hall of Fame last September. His award was accepted by Margaret Seres (M.S. SED '64, M.S.

Bar code technology. Magnetic recording. You've probably heard of them.Invented at Armour Institute of Technology's Research Foundation, the research branch of Illinois Tech's predecessor Armour Institute, in 1939, thewas poised to chart a new course in Antarctic exploration. The 55-foot-long mobile laboratory on wheels was designed to house Admiral Richard E. Byrd and his team on his third expedition to the continent and was offered in response to Byrd's 1934 second expedition in which he nearly died from carbon monoxide poisoning and poor health. Developed by Thomas Poulter, an Armour researcher and explorer whom Byrd credited with rescuing him in 1934, the vehicle also featured a dark room, machine shop, kitchen, and lab, and carried a Beechcraft biplane, which was to be used for aerial expeditions.Theof the Snow Cruiser were considered innovative at the time. It boasted four 10-foot-tall Goodyear retractable tires, backup battery storage, a diesel-electric powertrain, and a heating system using engine coolant that circulated throughout the cabin. The $150,000 vehicle ($2.5 million today, factoring inflation) benefited from corporate backers and was constructed at the Pullman Company south of Chicago.touted the Snow Cruiser \"as fantastic as a product of Jules Verne's brain,\" and the vehicle drew top national media coverage and crowds of thousands of onlookers as it made its way from Chicago to board the shipin Boston for delivery to Antarctica.Unfortunately, the Snow Cruiser was a dud. Even before it arrived at its destination it experienced a number of issues\u2014from getting stuck under a Chicago underpass to hitting a bridge and then driving into a creek in Ohio. Upon docking at the snowy continent in 1940, one of its wheels broke through a wooden ramp as it was being unloaded from the carrying ship. Once on land the Snow Cruiser traveled one mile before sinking into the snow, its tires failing to provide sufficient traction.Although Byrd reported that his expedition discovered \"900 miles of unknown coastline that explorers had been seeking for a hundred years,\" the Snow Cruiser remained mostly stationary and was abandoned in 1940. After a 1958 rediscovery mission it was officially lost in the snow.In fall 2015\u2014of the Snow Cruiser's arrival in Antarctica\u2014Illinois Tech students in the Interprofessional Project (IPRO) Program embarked on a journey of their own: to revisit the Snow Cruiser.

Saxena, assistant professor of psychology in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program at Illinois Tech, wanted to better understand theof being a target of workplace incivility for women in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.Saxena and her team of graduate and undergraduate students decided to explore the immediate and long-term experience of being a victim of workplace mistreatment.\"We know that incivility leads to a variety of negative outcomes, but we do not know the target's experiential elements of this mistreatment\", says Saxena. \"What happens to the target in the moment, what happens over time, and how does this mistreatment influence their work-performance and decisions to stay or leave STEM?\"She was especially interested in a woman'sor what is happening at the moment of incivility and how it changes through time, influencing long-term outcomes, such as how women cope after negative interactions.\"We wanted to understand what's happening when you are the victim\u2014in the moment\u2014what are you feeling, what goes through your mind,\" says Saxena. \"In an immediate sense, what happens cognitively, and in the long-term, what happens behaviorally.\"To answer questions such as these, Saxena and her team engaged in an in-depth evaluation of the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive consequences of workplace incivility for women in STEM. Standard industrial-organizational psychology literature defines incivility as low-intensity, deviant behavior with an ambiguous intent to harm. Such negative interpersonal acts in the workplace include casual rudeness, covert remarks, ambiguous personal insults, devaluation of work efforts, and speaking over someone.The team's study, conducted during 2014\u201315, found that every female participant had experienced incivility at her workplace in the last 12 months. Additionally, women experienced multiple negative emotions when they became a target of uncivil behavior, each ranging in intensity and duration. These negative emotions lasted through time and were strong enough to disrupt performance by hijacking cognitive or mental resources and causing participants to \"re-live\" the experience through rumination. The study also found that when female participants politely confronted the perpetrators of incivility, they experienced positive emotions.\"The consequences of incivility can be long-lasting. How targets cope with the incident is key to whether there will be long-term performance decrements or intentions to quit,\" says Saxena. \"Organizations can prevent long-term negative outcomes by encouraging dialogue and offering healthier ways for the target to cope\".Saxena's research lab at Illinois Tech uses theto capture the lived-through experience of working. Real employees respond to questions as they go about their daily work tasks in real time. Aspects of work behaviors, performance, emotions, health, well-being, and various psychological experiences are captured in their natural context (the workplace) using electronic devices such as smart phones or specially created computer programs that work within research participant's Web browsers.The team is still analyzing the data, which was collected from women across a variety of age groups and from across the nation; participants had advanced doctoral or post-doctoral degrees in STEM fields. As a next step, Saxena is interested in studying women in STEM in academia versus women in STEM in industry and early career professionals versus more advanced career professionals.\"Human behavior at work fascinates me,\" says Saxena. \"To understand the inner experience of work and how that influences health and well-being so as to ultimately have a positive impact on people's work life is my key objective.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/looking-ordinary-and-unusual", "content": "Kelly Lohr's academic journey thus far seems to be both straightforward\u2014and anything but. She keeps heading east, first traveling from her home in Greeley, Colo., to Chicago to enroll at Illinois Tech and then on to Providence, R.I., where she is currently a graduate student in the industrial design program at Rhode Island School of Design. A self-described \"designer of ideas,\" Lohr (MSE '13) was only the second woman at Illinois Tech to be elected president of the Student Government Association and founded a coffee club at the university as part of her quest to discover venues in Chicago where Illinois Tech students could gather to exchange ideas and talk.For someone so focused, Lohr seems to delight in detours. And for someone so comfortable with change, there are certain things that definitely get her attention\u2014like using old-fashioned felt as a design material. The simple textile became the cozy covering of Whaley, a ride-on toy for toddlers, in one of Lohr's graduate student projects. Noting that women use modified bungee cords as hair elastics, she repurposed the colorful bands as the basis of StripeCatch, her cell phone case that combines form and function.reached out to the aspiring industrial designer to share some thoughts at the corner of engineering and good design.I knew in high school that I wanted an engineering background that would support the work I would someday do as a designer. I saw industrial design and material science as very logical partners, and in many ways they are; however, trying to make it all work logically in reality is not so straightforward. Understanding fracture mechanics helps me to design stronger joints or more functional perforations, and those moments are small joys. I'm in a stage of my career where research and learning are very important to me\u2014designing experiments, testing unknowns, and using evidence to validate decisions. It's a really important process that both designers and engineers need, but they excel in very different ways. I feel lucky to have seen both interpretations.I probably notice about 20 percent of what is actually going on; I'm no Sherlock Holmes and this world can be overwhelming. I do tend to notice things that are related to what I'm researching. So for a while I was researching felt, and I noticed all of the weird ways felt was being used in the world; it was a charm shaped like a horse on a friend's backpack, padding to protect a wood floor from being scratched, the main material of a chic fall coat, and cheap prototyping material for one of my classmates. I was designing a child's toy and chose felt to evoke warmth, softness, and protection. It helps to always have some research question in the back of your mind, like \"what are all the ways people use felt in everyday life?\" It's combining insights about people with a vision of how to act on those insights that makes design thinking a desired capability in business and worthwhile for universities to include in curricula. Not to mention, the process is really enjoyable, on top of being practical. In a universal sense, good design is intentional about which audience it's serving and considerate of the needs of that audience. What I'm really delivering are insights and ways to move forward with them.RISD:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/tomahawk", "content": "Third-year business administration undergraduate specializing in mechanical engineering: Joined IIT Motorsports Formula SAE during her first year and has worked on the current generation of the racecar, WISER Tomahawk, which was entered into the 2015 Formula Hybrid Competition, held April 27\u201330 at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, N.H.Banks says that while men have outnumbered women on the IIT Motorsports Formula SAE team, members share in camaraderie and professionalism. \"I've seen a lot of respect from the students here,\" she says, \"because the focus is about learning and innovating\u2026\" She notes that one of the biggest issues the team contends with is changeover, as international-exchange students, for example, join the team for one year and then return to their home countries.

It varies, but I probably did something on each part of the car from every corner\"\"This has actually been a three-year project for me; I'm one of the few members who have been with the car since the beginning and it's kind of hard to summarize three years of working on one single car.

The only things that are not because you can't really make them are the wheels and tires. The shocks are also purchased. The motors are semi-purchased; they are custom-made for us or custom-stacked based off of our design, but the entire casing as a whole is completely designed by us.

The team that worked on the powertrain came up with the design for the motors. The rotor and the stator (stationary part of a motor) were sent out separately. For a hub motor the specifications are quite stringent. You have to have them synchronized to each other\u2014if one wheel spins faster than the other the car will start doing doughnuts. Even in a research atmosphere, it is challenging to take on the responsibility of mounting this permanent magnet-based rotor onto the stator; it requires a lot of engineering judgment along with the right tooling and the right presence of mind. Our students did all of this work, which is extremely impressive, especially for an undergraduate and master's-level team. It is well beyond their predicted capabilities.\"\"We're basically a club that uses IPRO (IIT's hallmark Interprofessional Projects Program) as its model. Students understand what it means to build a startup from scratch. They are beginning to realize that it's not enough for faculty to have a cool idea; they also need to help raise the money to make it happen. The carbon fiber for the body and some software were donated, the motors were purchased at a significant markdown, and WISER and other groups provided cash support. The students are also learning how to manage a team primarily composed of their peers. Since students receive no academic credit for the program, I've coordinated an IPRO and several senior-level electrical design projects on the car as independent study courses.\"\"The frame of the vehicle is made out of carbon fiber and we had absolutely no idea how to go about the carbon-fiber process. The students had to talk to professionals in this area and build the car from the ground up with very little experience. We've had a tremendous learning curve going into the design of this car.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/he-said-yes-dress", "content": "I need to be honest about something.Over the past year, I spent a lot of time in the IIT Archives in the lower level of Paul V. Galvin Library on Mies Campus, secretly hoping I might end up being the person who discovered a famous (or infamous) student whose former presence in ourclassrooms would come as a surprise (or shock) to today's university community.\u00a0 As the co-chair of IIT's 125th-anniversary celebration along with Betsy Hughes, vice president of Institutional Advancement, I went to the archives looking for stories about people, places, and things associated with Illinois Tech's history that for whatever reason, had remained hidden from view or were otherwise lost for more than a century.I figured, if I were lucky, I might find another Martin \"Marty\" Cooper (EE '50, M.S. '57), widely acknowledged as the father of the handheld cellular phone, or a Marvin Camras (EE '40, M.S. '42), whose research made magnetic tape recording possible, or even a Susan Solomon (CHEM '77), whose findings confirmed the presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica. In other words, I went looking for a previously unsung engineer or a scientist whose work had been overshadowed or under-appreciated.Instead I found a former editor of the French edition ofmagazine, a haute couture designer whose dresses, suits, and gowns were worn by Hollywood and European royalty. His name was Main Rousseau Bocher, also known as Mainbocher, and he studied at Lewis Institute, one of the forerunners of Illinois Tech, in 1907.The IIT Archives was not the place where I first ran across his name. My late mother-in-law, a stylish woman whose husband was an auto industry executive in the 1970s, gave me a gift one Christmas that was life-changing and eye-opening: a subscription to. The bible of fashion, it remains chock full of the latest comings and goings of designers from fashion houses in the United States and Europe\u2014and where I first read about Mainbocher.I knew him as the man who had designed Wallis Simpson's wedding dress for her marriage to Edward VIII as well as the uniforms for the World War II WAVES in 1942, the American Girl Scouts in 1946, and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve in 1951. Mainbocher's clients, including the actors Loretta Young and Claudette Colbert as well as C. Z. Guest and other New York society matrons, idolized him for his ability to make them look \"well-bred.\" His clothes reflected his deep understanding of what his clients wanted and how they wanted to be seen. Luxurious fabrics, quality workmanship, and cuts that flattered without shouting were Mainbocher's hallmarks.For the next 40 years, I would remember his name. Perhaps it was that his suits seemed to embody the elegance and grace associated with understated affluence or that the models wearing his gowns always appeared to be confident, albeit a bit remote. Maybe it was his designs, which were captured by some of the world's most legendary photographers. Or was it that he had fashioned for himself a life that took him beyond the edges of his middle-class, Midwestern family into a world of which most of us can only dream?Whatever the reason I now will proudly be able to tell people that Mainbocher is one of IIT's own and another fascinating, compelling, and exciting personality from the university's illustrious past."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/it-was-one-gas-ride-baby", "content": ", a missile-shaped, pearlescent-blue rocket car roared down thein Wendover, Utah, and into the record books because a derring-do band of technically brilliant car enthusiasts, IIT engineering students and their professors, and one highly regarded academic visionary\u2014energy researcher Henry R. Linden (Ph.D. CHE '52)\u2014believed that it could. Named for the color of ignited liquefied natural gas (LNG) that served as fuel for the vehicle, The Blue Flame (TBF), driven by Gary Gabelich, blew away the existing land speed record (LSR) set in 1965 by 30 mph.A unique set of structural, aerodynamic, and mechanical features developed by Reaction Dynamics, Inc. and Illinois Tech worked in concert to shoot The Blue Flame down the Bonneville Salt Flats not once, but twice. According to rules established by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile, the average speed was calculated by the average of two runs\u2014the vehicle needed to make a run in one direction, turn around, and make a second run in the opposite direction within one hour's time.Here are some of the major specs that helped to make the nearly 38-foot-long, two-ton (when empty) Blue Flame a record breaker:The central chassis structure beginning at the rear of the nose cone was a riveted, stressed aluminum skin over aluminum ring structures and aluminum I-beam longerons, or stringers, similar to what is used in the construction of an aircraft's body.A triangular wheel layout with the front wheels one-inch apart inside the fuselage and the rear wheels seven-feet apart provided roll stability and moved the aerodynamic center of pressure rearward. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company individually tested the wheels and tires at more than 850 mph; however, in 1970 the company required that the maximum speed be kept below 700 mph.The Blue Flame was designed to operate in the supersonic realm above Mach 1. The most critical part of the aerodynamic design was to provide vehicle stability through the estimated transonic speed transition of Mach 0.9 through Mach 1.1.The nose shape was a Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ogive (roundly tapered end) to avoid separation of the airstream at Mach speeds.The fuselage cross-section was a tri-oval shape with the \"V\" pointing toward the ground. This was to avoid lift from any shockwaves deflected upward from the ground surface.The vertical tail fin added to the vehicle's stability much like the feathers on an arrow.Parachutes and disc brakes were used to stop the car. At high speed the first parachute was deployed by a slug fired by compressed air projecting a small pilot parachute, which then pulled the high-speed parachute from its housing. At 300 mph the driver then released a larger, low-speed parachute and finally applied the wheel brakes (rear wheels only) at 100 mph to come to a stop. A second complete parachute system provided redundancy.The nose cone held two titanium spheres with high-pressure air for pressurizing the hydrogen peroxide tank and a smaller fiberglass-reinforced sphere containing helium for pressurizing the cryogenic liquefied natural gas (LNG) tank. Behind the front wheels a large stainless steel tank held the hydrogen peroxide propellant and a smaller aluminum tank contained the LNG propellant, which were pressurized to 600 psi. The rocket motor, plumbing, control valves, parachute canisters, and various accessory hardware pieces of equipment were behind the cockpit. The Blue Flame carried a fuel load of five gallons of LNG and 180 gallons of hydrogen peroxide.\"The Blue Flame's 630.478 mi/h (1,014.656 km/h) record speed in the kilometer remains the fastest ever at the Bonneville Salt Flats; the 1,014 km/h record speed was the first record over 1,000 km/h and resulted in much acclaim throughout Europe,\" says Dick Keller, who was a chief technologist at IIT Research Institute when he and colleague Ray Dausman developed their idea for the X-1 rocket dragster, the prototype to TBF, in the mid-1960s. \"The 622.407 mi/h record speed in the mile lasted 13 years. The 1,014.656 km/h kilometer record speed lasted 27 years.\"Dausman (who originally suggested using a rocket to power TBF but left the project before the car went to the salt flats) and Keller enlisted the services of dragster builder Pete Farnsworth to form Reaction Dynamics, Inc., the core team that designed and fabricated the vehicle. Keller presented the concept to Linden, then president of the Institute of Gas Technology, an IIT affiliate; Linden subsequently obtained funding for the vehicle from a large group of American natural gas industry supporters. Linden also enlisted a cadre of talented IIT students led by faculty members T. Paul Torda and Sarunas C. Uzgiris (M.S. ME '63, Ph.D. MAE '66), who refined the aerodynamic qualities of the car by incorporating a specially designed nose for low drag, triangular body cross-section shape, and slight nose-down body slant.The Blue Flame, now displayed at Germany's, primed the possibility that LNG could be utilized as a clean transportation-fuel alternative, an option still being researched today. And the insatiable desire to surpass world-record speed also continues, as two groups\u2014a British team and teamfrom Australia\u2014are working to achieve 1,000mi/h in 2016 in Hakskeen Pan, a dry lakebed in South Africa's Northern Cape province.Members of The Blue Flame crew and Illinois Tech's Henry R. Linden Professor of Energy share memories of the day the rocket car broke the land speed record and note the added significance of the achievement.\"The Blue Flame has always been my favorite LSR car not only because she was really slick and pretty\u2014boasting the best technical backing of any project ever before or since 1970\u2014but also because The Blue Flame team [members] were total professionals,\" says drag-racing record holder Rosco McGlashan, who is already the 'Fastest Aussie on Earth' and has been working to become the fastest man on Earth for more than 50 years.\"Richard Keller has been a godsend to our project assisting us with design ideas and\u00a0rectifying construction problems we had to\u00a0overcome.\u00a0My team is building a car with a 62,000-lbf [pound-force, or pounds of thrust] bi-propellant motor; it has often been referred to as 'The Blue Flame on Steroids.'\u00a0 We've had some real highs and heaps of real lows but [what] keeps us motivated are the achievements the pioneers before us have won, including the great work Illinois Institute of Technology did back then. Their research is our bible.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/blue-flame", "content": "\"I do believe that out of the whole crew, not including driver Gary Gabelich, I was faster in the quarter-mile. I had driven 215 mi/h at the Rockford Dragway. I had also finished up a twin-engine car and went 180 mi/h in that.\"\"I spent nearly all of my time in the construction of the vehicle and welded the entire rear suspension; the front suspension was welded entirely by Kenny McCarthy. I was shocked by what was being planned for the front suspension and front axle. As with the rear suspension, the design was handed to us. The design of the front axle was crucial to the performance of the vehicle and it made me feel safe as the alternate driver. It would have really hurt if we had broken the front axle\u2014we wouldn't have had to worry about a record or having a vehicle left with a pair of front wheels inside the body. That was engineering coming from IIT. The axle was actually clamped into the frame of the steering portion of the vehicle and tapered on each side. I looked at it with big eyes. The idea was that if there were any bumping going on, the axle would deflect the movement instead of being sheared off. With the tires on, each wheel weighed about 300 pounds apiece. If that axle had broke it would have made for a really bad day.\"\"There were no press there when we set the record; the film crew had also already left by that day, which was six weeks after we'd arrived at the flats. But we have photographs of Joe Petrelli, the chief timer, on the record. We had permission to stay at the flats until we got rained out or snowed out. We had some light rain and ran in the rain. Petrelli wasn't ready for that because nobody had done it before, apparently. We had the car fueled and ready to go. We had zero problems running the car in light showers.\"Director of business operations and then VP of business ops for the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT), who helped to form the Gas Research Institute (GRI) with Henry R. Linden (ChE '52), IIT research professor and president of IGT (IGT and GRI were combined to become today's Gas Technology Institute.)I drove Henry to work one day and he told me about the project's problems. He also knew that I had an interest in cars, had done a little timed racing, and was driving a Corvette then. I told Henry that if there was anything I could do to help, he should let me know. So I dropped him off, parked the car, and came into my office. I had just hung up my coat when my secretary said that Henry would like to see me in his office. The IGT project liasion, Dr. Robert Rosenberg, was there, too. In a non-dramatic fashion, Henry said that he wanted to make a change in the project and that effective today, I would take it over.\"Good communication, setting priorities, and teamwork are three things you really need for any successful project. You also need a little bit of luck. We were filming the runs at the salt flats and the photographer had a Ford van that had a high-performance engine. We were running out of fuel for The Blue Flame. So what we did, which was perfectly legal, was put a push bar in the front of his van and at the start of the run, the van pushed the blue flame up to about 100 mph. We had a chase car signaling alongside and at about 100 mph, the van was waved off and Gary [Gabelich] ignited the rocket. By getting that 100 mile-per-hour push we got an almost 1:1 speed pickup. We also had to hire a truck to drive all night from Buffalo, New York, where the fuel was and got it in on that day\u2014and went out and broke the record.\"Dietrich had a collection of 16 cars\u2014four Porsches, a BMW Z3, a super-charged Mercedes SLK240, a turbo-charged 1963 Corvair convertible, a 1956 14-hp BMW Isetta bubble car with a motorcycle engine, a 1970 Cadillac convertible, and a 1976 Bricklin, of which only about 2,000 were made.Served as an experimental engineer at IIT Research Institute from 1960\u201366 and then as chief technologist at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) from 1966\u201368\"Ray Dausman and I were working at IIT Research Institute; it was handy to work at a university with the resources of a large technical library, so we started looking up different types of rocket propellants because we thought if we're going to run this in front of people, we don't want to kill them. We came up with the idea of building a hydrogen peroxide propellant model. We both lived in IIT's Carman Hall and didn't have any money, so we thought we could design a little rocket, test it, and see if we could make the thing work. We tested the 25-lb. thrust rocket and thought we were successful. At that point we probably should have left it alone, but we kept thinking that maybe we could put it in a real car. The more we talked the more excited we got, so we took the little movies we made of the rocket running to my friend Pete Farnsworth, who was a dragster driver and builder. We told him about our idea to build a dragster and convinced him. We decided to build at hunk-scale\u2014upping our 25-lb. thrust rocket 100 times to 2,500 pounds\u2014and designed the X-1 dragster to put it in.\"\"Obviously, setting the record was a highlight. But, for me, the highlight came earlier. After Henry Linden began promoting the land speed record idea with his friends in the natural gas industry, he suggested they watch us run the X-1 rocket dragster [The Blue Flame prototype]. A delegation of natural gas executives came to watch us run the X-1 at the World Jet and Rocket Championship race in Oklahoma City on September 15, 1968. There were representatives from IGT, Northern Illinois Gas, the American Gas Association, and a couple of other natural gas distribution companies. Former world land speed record holders, Walt Arfons and Art Arfons were there with a 'steam' rocket and jet dragster, respectively. A half dozen other jets also raced that weekend. Chuck Suba, driving the X-1, set a new all-time drag racing record of 265.480 mph in 5.90 seconds elapsed time and embarrassed all of the other thrust cars. So impressed were these industry gentlemen that they agreed right there to fund The Blue Flame project. That was the highlight, followed by the low point on October 13 when Chuck Suba crashed a top fuel dragster and was killed.\"I raced bikes, primarily velodrome, in the early 1960s. I began master's racing in the 1980s\u2014road, criterium, time trial, and of course, on the track. Sprinting was always my forte; I won a few U.S. national championships. Also, racing in Europe for the world and EU championships, I was able to set records in the sprint races. Now I just ride for fun. I needed something I could haul my racing bikes in, so I've got a gasoline-powered Chrysler Pacifica. We also own a Nissan LEAF electric car and can get 80\u2013100 miles on a charge.In 1968, Thomas Morel was a Czechoslovakian immigrant who came to IIT to pursue graduate education in mechanical engineering. Andrew A. Fejer, former chair of the IIT Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering, introduced Morel to Professor T. Paul Torda, who had been tapped to serve as aerodynamic design consultant on The Blue Flame project. Torda assigned Morel\u2014who attributes his good fortune, in part, to serendipity\u2014as the sole student tasked with determining the shape of the rocket car.Morel met weekly with Torda whose teaching philosophy was to let students come up with solutions to the research problem, using him only as a resource. Torda pointed Morel in the direction of some valuable materials: declassified papers on tests previously conducted by the United States Army in the area of supersonic airplanes and munitions. Morel says he studied these documents and derived from them the first ideas for the design. Not all of them worked. \"In the original design that I came up with for the car, it had wing-like fairings over the rear structure and the wheels to shield them from air drag. But transonic wind tunnel tests indicated that the 'wings' would create lift,\" he explains. \"What was most scary about that was when the car was going down the track at a high speed or the speed of sound, which was the intention and what we hoped to be able to do, the car could lift off the ground making it very dangerous for the driver. So eventually we modified the design.\"The Blue Flame was designed to be just a skin over tanks of fuel, cigar-shaped. One original idea was to have its cross-section shaped like a rounded triangle with the apex oriented toward the ground to minimize the effect of shockwaves formed underneath. The body was inclined a couple of degrees toward the nose, which was calculated to ensure that there was a force always keeping it down but not too much as to overload the tires. The general design has stood the test of time because most, if not all, of the [land speed] vehicles that came after have a similar shape. For me the biggest challenge was to come up with something that was low-drag and low-lift. I must say that when I went to see the trials in October 1969, I was worried that the vehicle could take off upward. It was always my greatest worry as that would have endangered the driver.\"\"Today, I'm president of Gamma Technologies in Westmont Illinois, a company that develops computer software that designs engines for vehicles. The software is provided to various companies around the world\u2014practically every automaker today uses our software to design its engines. This requires a lot of fluid mechanics of which I got introduced to in my courses at IIT and through The Blue Flame project. I studied mostly structures as an undergraduate in Prague but as a graduate student, I very quickly changed my direction under the influence of Professor Torda, Professor Fejer, and Professor Morkovin. Fluid mechanics is behind the design of our software\u2014in combustion, the fluid flow of engines, and turbocharging. A lot of what I do today is a continuation of what started for me at IIT.\"Thirty-nine-year veteran of the Institute of Gas Technology and the Gas Research Institute who served as manager of personnel and building servicesThe hydrogen peroxide propellant and the natural gas were kept in separate tanks. When the driver stepped on the throttle pedal, the peroxide was forced through a catalyst pack with silver screens that caused a chemical reaction. The peroxide (HO) broke down to water vapor (HO) and oxygen (O), and created about 1,400\u00b0 F of temperature. Within a 1,400\u00b0 F oxygen-rich environment any carbon fuel, especially something like concentrated liquid natural gas, is going to instantly burn. That was the whole idea, to get it to burn in the combustion chamber, giving us the additional thrust. And it did. It increased the car's speed to well over 600 mph and we were able to break the record. Even the X-1 rocket dragster that preceded The Blue Flame was a monopropellant vehicle. The dual-propellant rocket engine, designed for The Blue Flame, provided a way to greatly increase the thrust necessary to break the world land speed record.\"We stayed at a motel in Wendover, a town that straddles the state line between Utah and Nevada. The car stayed at the flats and one of the crew members had to stay with the car overnight in a mobile trailer. Being the low man on the totem pole I got the first night out there, which was kind of fortunate because I got to meet the former land speed record holder, Craig Breedlove. The following morning, while the folks in town were still having breakfast and I was out on the flats alone, I saw a Cessna circling and then landing on the flats. Two people were aboard and Craig Breedlove, who I'd known from pictures, was one of them. He got out and asked me if this was my car. So I told him yes. He was very interested in the construction and the suspension. When the rest of the crew came out and I told them that I had met Breedlove, who, of course had been long gone, no one would believe me.\"In those days the Bonneville Salt Flats was the place for land speed records. Bonneville is an ancient lake with water 2 to 4 inches below the surface, which is as hard as concrete. In the winter the water table comes up above the salt; by late summer, it dips below and leaves the salt flats perfectly flat. I was at the salt flats for five weeks, which is a long time to be on something that pretty much looks like the surface of the moon. Because of the evaporation of the water that is below the salt, our feet were freezing and yet we were baking because it's a desert. We went out to survey the area and were told to wear rubber-soled shoes because leather would disintegrate, just from the moisture. Most of the people walking around had sores on their lips, just like you see in desert movies.\": One of my jobs was to coordinate with doctors [T. Paul] Torda and [Sarunas C.] Uzgiris and the master's degree students during the engineering phase of designing TBF. I made several trips to IIT to make sure that the work they were doing, in theory, could actually be built by RDI and stay within time and budget constraints. The students had an extremely important opportunity to help design and engineer an exciting product that actually would be built, operate, and perform dramatically in full view of an interested and knowledgeable world.: My first interest in automobiles came from listening to the Indianapolis 500 on the radio with my dad in about 1947. My first hands-on experience with building a car started in 1952 when I bought a broken down 1934 Ford-based racing-track roadster that had been raced at Soldiers Field in Chicago. A year later\u2014before it was legal for me to drive\u2014I had gotten the car back in operating condition, including installing a newly rebuilt engine. By the time I was 25 years old I had attended the University of Illinois School of Engineering, completed almost three years of tool and die school, was a good welder and machinist, and had helped to build 25 cars (mostly race cars). One of the dragsters that I designed and built the engine for was the fastest B-fuel dragster in the world in 1963. Another dragster that I designed, built, and drove, held the unlimited track-elapsed time record at Great Lakes Dragaway in Wisconsin from 1961\u20131963. Then I started to formulate ideas to build a rocket-powered dragster, which became the X-1 rocket car.: I felt euphoria at setting the record, relief from the extreme stress of the past two years completing the project, sadness that we were out of a job, and shortly thereafter, the reapplication of stress when I thought about what is next! I have had many great moments in drag racing but none with the worldwide importance of setting the world-unlimited land speed record and being the first to achieve that record at more than 1,000 kilometers per hour.: The reunion happened on October 24, 2015. It was a four-hour luncheon attended by more than 90 people. We showed previously unseen movie footage of the last runs of TBF along with a soundtrack of driver Gary Gabelich calling out the speeds on the two record runs. My wife, Leah, and I presented 21 awards to the people who built TBF and to individuals such as the IIT graduate students and others who did major system design work.: I drive a Chrysler Town and Country Limited Mini-Van.

A line of Chinese geese and a Bantam rooster couple waddle, squawk, and cluck in the direction of the driver, Mitch Bornstein (LAW '95), and his passenger, who climb out of the Chevy only to be met by a meowing member of the welcoming party, Asbestos, the feral tabby.The dark-brown head of a mustang named Samson protrudes from a corncrib where he is taking shelter from biting flies. He is ever vigilant, having been forcibly evicted and separated from his herd at age six from federal rangeland in Nevada in a helicopter roundup through the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM). As if not traumatic enough, the horse was then adopted by an individual in Illinois and over the next six years, physically abused by one or more owners before being taken in by \"Amy,\" owner of the farm in Woodstock. When she realized that she had an animal that was wild by nature and more crucially, fearful and hateful due to lack of proper nurturing, she contacted Bornstein, who is locally known for successfully training horses that most no one else can.\"The simple answer to what drove me to work with damaged and abused horses is that I have a knack for it and am good at it,\" says Bornstein, 45, a Highland Park, Ill., native who trained his first problem horse when he was 20 and who now has a client waiting list in the dozens. \"From my very first horse I felt that there was an intuitive element at work and that I could size up a horse pretty well. I could train an easygoing, run-of-the-mill horse, which is fine. But I figure that I could take that same amount of time and instead help a horse that someone tells me is on its way to a slaughterhouse in Mexico unless its problem can be fixed.\"Beginning in the fall of 2009, Bornstein spent nearly two years intensely working with Samson and documented his experiences in, published this summer by St. Martin's Press. A former litigator who has since changed his practice to consultation as his equine workload increased, he selected IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law for its renowned legal research and writing program headed by Professor Ralph Brill. It took St. Martin's Press Editor Daniela Rapp, who specializes in animal-related books, one weekend to decide to publish Bornstein's memoir.\"The [books] that would be classified [at St. Martin's] as memoir all have two things in common: the right mix of humor and emotional depth, and a very strong bond between the human and the animal. When Samson's story came in on submission, I had been looking for a great horse book for a little while, and the manuscript had both the right tone and the bond,\" Rapp explains. \"And it is also such a necessary book, given that many readers might be utterly and sadly unaware of the plight of the American mustang.\"Mitch Bornstein (LAW '95) interacts with Samson the mustang and tells a story about an event that showed him just how special his relationship is with the wild horse.Bornstein continues to make the three-hour round-trip drive to Samson's farm twice each week to groom, exercise, and ride him, and considers his relationship with the now nearly 18-year-old gelding as special and significant; all of his work with the horse has been pro bono. He regards Samson as representative of the remaining American mustangs on public lands, whose status continues to be threatened across nine western states in spite of the passage of the.\"If one less person hits a dog or a cat or a horse, or if a few readers go to the Internet to learn about the wild horse issue and perhaps call their congressman or congresswoman, then I've accomplished something with this book,\" says Bornstein. \"After all, this is a story about redemption, love\u2014and hope.\"American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign:BLM Wild Horse and Burro Program:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/provost-president-builder", "content": "It is the week preceding Chicago's annual Air and Water Show, and the blue-sky view from Alan W.

I grew up in that type of community, where family was much bigger than who you were related to; we had this very interwoven dynamic where many people were involved.\"Both his parents valued education, and at the age of 11 Cramb was one of four local students who passed the national qualifying exams ensuring admission to, a college-preparatory high school. Knowing that the young Cramb excelled in mathematics, chemistry, and physics, the school's headmaster suggested that he consider the metallurgy program at thein Glasgow. An American professor on sabbatical from the University of Pennsylvania encouraged Cramb to become his doctoral student; he was accepted into the program on a full scholarship. Cramb says that his parents were very supportive of his educational decision and that he even had his travel ticket paid for\u2014with money earned during the three years he was a professional disc jockey while pursuing his undergraduate degree.\"My father was an absolute music aficionado. My parents allowed me to buy albums when I was growing up and they would listen to them, too\u2014all types of music from the big bands to punk rock,\" he explains. \"Someone asked my friend and me to play records at a local hall for people to dance, which was new then because people were used to dancing to bands. So we put our money together and bought a double record player and amplifiers. The next thing you know, we were playing at a bar on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at lunchtime and on Saturday nights. We stopped only when I decided to go to America. I also have a very nice acoustic guitar that I bought when I came here in '75. I moved into my apartment and had $400 left, so I bought the guitar because I liked to play. I haven't played in a long, long time, though.\"After graduate school, Cramb spent the first part of his career at Inland Steel Company and at Bethlehem Steel Corporation, both now defunct, conducting and managing research as well as teaching technology best practices to steel workers. He entered academe in 1986 at Carnegie Mellon University and obtained his first departmental administrative position through a man who would become a \"great mentor\" to him: John L. Anderson, Illinois Tech Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering and former president.\"John is an amazing person with an amazing empathy for people; I've learned a lot about that from him,\" Cramb acknowledges. \"Earlier in my career I was less empathetic and didn't listen as much. I've learned by watching him and others that you need to listen a lot and really get beyond the words to what people mean. I've also learned from him the need to understand the position of the university in the community and the position of the university within other universities.\"Before coming to Illinois Tech, Cramb served as dean of engineering and John A. Clark and Edward T. Crossan Professor of Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Then as now, students remain his focus. Even though he is widely credited with making significant contributions to today's steel-casting process, Cramb is quick to include the students who were also involved in that research. He adds that his greatest accomplishment in metallurgy was that he mentored 19 doctoral students who are now living across the globe and making their own contributions to the field. And, as a father of two, Cramb says that observing his daughter Liana navigate her way through her first year of college gave him an intimate view of how important being a real member of the university community was to her. It all starts with a sense of belonging.\"One of my goals as president is to make sure that the university values all of its people, from the faculty to the staff to the students, and knows how important it is that we work together,\" says Cramb. \"We also need to connect our future alumni with our past alumni to develop networks so that when a student comes to our university they're not just here for four years; they've joined a club for life. We need to think about not just what happens during the years they are here but what happens with their relationship with the university over time.\"Michael Byrne\u2014fellow countryman, university roommate, wedding best man, and godfather to one of Cramb's daughters\u2014says that his friend of more than 40 years is the right person to encourage teamwork and further promote IIT esprit de corps.\"The university has made an admirable choice with Alan. As I think back to the highlights of his career, he has what I always thought of as star quality,\" says Byrne, senior manager for technology and strategy at TimkenSteel. \"He's particularly good at building relationships. When I worked with Alan in the industrial world, one of the things I noticed about him is that he can work across all levels of an organization, meeting with people and relating to them very, very well. My one word for Alan is charismatic. He is a very engaging individual, and a good and kind man.\"Speaking as Cramb's predecessor, Anderson concurs.\"Good academic leadership is grounded in decision-making skills, respect for the institution and its people, high standards of performance for himself and the university, and a full understanding of the mission and culture of academe,\" Anderson says. \"Alan Cramb has all of these qualities.\u00a0Furthermore, international recognition of his technical and professional achievements, including membership in the National Academy of Engineering, will bring widespread attention to IIT.

But in the mid-twentieth century, when Dennis Irie (ARCH '66) grew up there, it was a bustling community complete with its own hospital, school, post office, store, theater, and fire department.\"You may think 'plantation' and relate that to the South and slavery, but that wasn't the case at Ewa. The plantation treated its workers well,\" says Irie, a retired architect who now lives in Honolulu with his wife, Patsy. \"The children had a lot of nice amenities and the people in the close-knit community had decent homes. So they generally have good memories about the place.\"He hopes to capture and secure those memories for future generations through his forthcoming book,Irie spent a decade gathering photos, stories, and oral histories from those who lived on the plantation from the 1940s to 1970. After retirement, he wrote a narrative, drew town maps, organized the photos and stories into chapters, and now is close to completing his manuscript. The final book will include the personal accounts of more than 60 former plantation residents.\"Many former Ewa kids contributed to this collection\u2026 Some accounts are funny and some are wistful,\" writes former plantation resident Carolyn Okinaga in the book's introduction. \"[The book] truly reflects this love for the Ewa where we grew up.\"Irie recalls a pleasant childhood, including playing sports and hanging out at the plantation's recreation center. Although he had chores, such as raking and cutting grass, he never worked for the plantation company.\"Parents generally made a big push for their children to get a good education and to pursue careers outside of the plantation. It's interesting that a lot of us went on to become educators, engineers, architects, dentists, or attorneys,\" he says.The grandson of Japanese immigrants, Irie was a third-generation Ewa resident. His grandparents came to Oahu in the late 1800s when his grandfather accepted a position as a contract laborer for Ewa (he was later promoted to supervisor). His parents also worked on the plantation and the family lived in a three-bedroom rental home there for $40 per month.Their lives shifted suddenly on December 7, 1941, with the attack on nearby.\"Friends who were fishing in the West Loch of Pearl Harbor quickly came running up the hill back to the village after seeing all the explosions,\" recounts a story from Irie's book, contributed by two residents who lived on a part of the plantation that overlooked the harbor. \"Many gathered at the overlook to take in all that was happening, not realizing this was the start of a war.\"When the United States entered World War II, Irie's maternal grandparents were placed in internment camps on the mainland, while his mother was allowed to continue working in the plantation's main office and care for the 1-year-old Irie. His father, who had graduated from the University of Missouri, was part of the U.S. Army's 100Infantry Battalion, an all-Japanese unit that was sent to fight in the European Theater. He was among the 10 men from their community of 4,000 who died in the war.Irie recently rescued a plaque honoring these men and had it installed in the courtyard of the Administration-Library Complex that he designed at the town's elementary school. He has created a storyboard for the courtyard that explains the plaque's significance so that, like his book, it can help future generations connect with their town's past.Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Plantation Archives:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/intellectual-matchmaker", "content": "\"People ask me today if I always knew that I wanted to be the chief academic officer of a university,\" says Frances Bronet (pronounced), from her partially furnished, 19th-floor IIT Tower office, just over one month into her job as President Alan W. Cramb's go-to senior administrator. \"What I did know, in fact, and as a 17-year-old, was that I could recognize genius. I could recognize other peoples' incredible intelligences and connect them, one to another.\"Even before she was aware of her interest in \"navigating and brokering relationships amongst people,\" the Montr\u00e9al-born Bronet was a perpetual pupil\u2014deriving information wherever possible, even shadowing her friends' university-educated parents. An overachiever, she enteredon a full scholarship and graduated with three bachelor's degrees in architecture and engineering before earning a master's degree from the Graduate School of Architecture and Planning at Columbia University.Prior to coming to Chicago\u2014\"the architectural capital of the modern world\"\u2014where she lives in a Mies-designed building in Streeterville with her husband, a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) educator, Bronet last served at the University of Oregon, where she was ACSA Distinguished Professor and dean of the School of Architecture and Allied Arts.

Of course, Alan Cramb, the new president, was a huge draw. His understanding of what IIT is and what a world-class institution is and how to support it was central to my coming. In doing a little more research I began to understand the core of this extraordinary student body and the leading-edge faculty, and how they are determined to make a difference in the world while creating the tools and investigative practices by which they could make that difference. The strategic plan impressed me by its focus on students and on excellence, by the action-oriented vision and implementation strategies. Seeing the IPRO [Interprofessional Projects] Program as a fundamental model for learning, knowing that positioning design across the curriculum was in play, and that the students were already engaged in global problem solving, were critical to why I came to IIT. And the opportunities I have to further build relationships amongst the disciplines, the other universities that Chicago houses, as well as industry partnerships are incredible.I grew up in the center of Montr\u00e9al with limited resources in a working-class family. We had a local place that was run by the \"Y\" called Neighborhood House that had after-school programs, and I would hang out there; the boys would play pool, and the girls and the boys would play Ping-Pong. There was also a jukebox and so I probably spent three hours a day dancing from the ages of eight through 13. Dance was significant to me because I was able to traverse multiple cultures. I went to school in the inner city; there were certain languages that we co-used, and certainly dance was one of them.Fast forward to my early thirties. I was trying to teach my architecture students how to understand the relationship of their bodies in space, what their drawings actually represented. We set up exercises that were based on full-scale installations. This became a theoretical enterprise for a fellow philosophy professor and me: How do we design space that allows for more than one way of occupying it? When we built dance installations, I would invite companies to do a performance in them. If three different dance companies fundamentally used the space that my students designed in a similar fashion, the students failed. The three different companies should have been able to imagine occupying the space differently. And yes, I could absolutely imagine transforming Crown Hall into a space for installation. How do you take a space that is familiar and predictable\u2014and allow the unpredictable to occur? This already happens in Crown Hall. Those kinds of transformations are critical for me.My first year will be a big year of learning and listening for me, understanding everything we do because it's a very rich array of arenas that we occupy. That's exciting to me. I am energized by the unfamiliar so I'm really looking forward to gaining access to domains I don't know that much about. I'm anticipating delving deep and building relationships with all of our university stakeholders, including developing teams across disciplines and agencies.I especially want to learn more about our faculty's research as well as our students' greatest desires, and how to support them in a socially rich, creative environment. Most importantly, continuing to build along with our constituents this dynamic think tank. After all, that was my teenage dream! It clearly exists, and my goal is to figure out its components. How do we reinforce the most cutting-edge research? How do we leverage the best and the brightest faculty, staff, and students as they come here? How do we celebrate the fact that they are pursuing epic challenges together?"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/inauguration-alan-w-cramb", "content": "On the afternoon of September 18, it seemed that all roads led not to Rome but to Chicago, specifically, the \"arena\" known as Hermann Hall Auditorium on Illinois Tech's Mies Campus, as Alan W.

Not simply pomp and circumstance, the procession was for many of the faculty a show of respect for someone who has represented them for the past seven years as provost. Indira Samarasekera, former colleague and friend of Cramb's for more than three decades, also hailed the new president in her keynote inaugural speech.The president emeritus of the University of Alberta likened Cramb's approach to the presidency as that of Theodore Roosevelt's \"man in the arena\" from Roosevelt's speech \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" about a figure who has the courage, tenacity, and talent to head a noble cause.\"I have watched Alan over the last 25 years with awe and have witnessed him explain the most complex of ideas in exquisite simplicity to those who have a full range of educational backgrounds,\" said Samarasekera. \"Alan's gift of oratory along with his intellect, vision, and capacity for clear-sighted leadership will be the hallmarks of his presidency.

While the president may be a gifted orator, what most impressed Wadhwani was the full breadth of Cramb's communications strengths.\"President Cramb's approachability and willingness to listen to students and work with them has really stood out to all of the students who I speak with; I'd like to thank him for that,\" said Wadhwani. \"He's won [the students'] trust and respect.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/engine-less-future-wiser-tomahawk", "content": "\"SAE has been the most important experience that I've had at IIT so far; it's definitely the most tangible project that I've seen at a university,\" says Katy Banks, Camras Scholar, third-year student at Stuart School of Business, and member of theteam. \"It's a huge undertaking and a wonderful thing to pour your time into; it has a lot of return.\"She and fellow members of the IIT Formula SAE team had entered their WISER Tomahawk racecar in the 2015collegiate competition in Loudon, N.H. and took home the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Innovation Award and a third-place General Motors Best-Engineered Hybrid System Award, among other honors.

Later he learned the total was significantly inflated for the type of work done. This disturbed the self-proclaimed gearhead, who has tinkered with cars since childhood. It also raised the question: If a mechanic could rip him off, how could everyday people protect themselves?Fortunately, there's now an app for that.Strados, a phone app developed by Samala and his business partner, Bingkun Zhao, connects to an online machine-learning platform that analyzes a vehicle's computer signals and alerts the owner to potential problems. Diagnosed issues are assigned a severity rating and a cost estimate. For example, Samala says that Strados might detect that a car's oxygen sensors are reading erratically and send an alert indicating a possible problem. Strados would then begin to investigate.\"It will let you know if you need to replace an oxygen sensor, which is about a $200 repair,\" Samala says. \"Without that warning, your failing sensor could lead to a catalytic converter failure, which can cost up to $3,000 to fix.\"An early Strados prototype included a small device that plugs into a car's diagnostic port, located under the steering wheel of vehicles made after 1996, but the latest version integrates with third-party devices.\"We're talking with potential hardware partners, so we don't have to do the extra work of developing a device,\" he says.Strados processes vehicle data using sophisticated algorithms and prediction models to determine whether a problem exists. The prototype has worked well on a handful of test vehicles. The creative duo's goal is to gather and test data from hundreds of vehicle makes/models to fine-tune their data models so that, according to Samala, \"the computer can do the calculations instead of us.\"Strados drew interest at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show and was included inmagazine's 2014 list of \".\" The budding company has been primarily funded from Samala and Zhao's own cash reserves and, for now, is relegated to being a part-time pursuit, as both men work full-time jobs.

Potential income may come from the insurance industry, which hungers for accurate driver mileage data and has been in conversation with Samala about the possibility of purchasing quarterly mileage updates.A beta version of Strados may become available by year's end on Google Play.\"America's Coolest College Startups 2014\":Strados: http://strados.co/#howitworks"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2015/marty-s-world", "content": "With his signature charm, Martin \"Marty\" Cooper (EE '50, M.S. '57) will not only tell you an improbable idea is possible, but he'll also map out a way to achieve it.If you don't believe it, consider your smartphone.In the early 1970s, communications giant AT&T dismissed the idea of personal cell phones and instead focused on what it thought people wanted: in-dash car telephones. The company planned to offer the service under the condition that it be the nation's sole mobile communications provider. When it sought to secure this monopoly from the Federal Communications Commission, Cooper and his team at Motorola sprang into action.They were determined to give people a truly mobile device that wouldn't keep them \"trapped in their cars.\" So, in a mind-blowing three months they created a prototype\u2014the 2.5-pound DynaTAC.On April 3, 1973, with a journalist in tow, Cooper took the DynaTAC outside a press conference in New York and dialed his rival at AT&T's Bell Labs to share the good news. The occasion marked the world's first personal cell phone call, which contributed materially to the demise of AT&T's planned monopoly. Forty-two years later, there are more than 7 billion cell phone subscribers worldwide. Clearly, Cooper saw something others missed.\"There were very few people who thought it would ever be big business, so I was really an outlier,\" says Cooper, who at 86 still serves as a consultant for the wireless industry. \"Yet there were two guys who really supported me: Bob Galvin [the late Illinois Tech Board of Trustees chair and Motorola CEO], who allowed the company to spend what today would be $1 billion on a technology with no projected revenues, and John Mitchell [EE '50], who taught me that people are inherently mobile. So IIT had a significant role in the creation of the cell phone.\"Cooper left Motorola in 1983 and went on to launch several companies, including two\u2014the consulting firmand GreatCall, Inc. (the maker of the senior-friendly Jitterbug phone)\u2014with his wife, Arlene Harris. Popularly known as the \"First Lady of Wireless,\" Harris complements Cooper. The two enjoy working together and sharing pursuits such as skiing, tennis, and the occasional spirited conversation.\"I am mad about her, but she is uncompromising,\" Cooper says. \"She's one of the smartest engineers I know and we sometimes argue, but the result is that I always learn something.\"Currently writing a book about the cell phone's creation, Cooper admits to being a dreamer and continues to envision the future of wireless technology. With successes beyond the cell phone that include expanding pager technology from single-building use to services that stretch across cities, Cooper continues to project and inspire. His uncanny vision prompted FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to state in a 2009article that the man sees \"how things should be\" and \"then he makes them happen.\" More recently, a video documentary about Cooper appears in the online magazine and video channel. He sees our world growing ever more connected and personal.Your future cell phone, he says, will \"learn\" your needs and preferences and include an app that automatically finds or builds other apps to meet those needs. It will also likely evolve into a voice- or thought-responsive implant that connects you to the Internet and other people. Social media will shift from a simple photo- and story-sharing platform to a collaborative online work environment, which allows everyone to contribute their knowledge and skills.\"Things like Twitter and Facebook have gotten us hooked into continuous communication, connection, and mental stimulation, which will lead to a productivity revolution that's going to make us all more wealthy,\" says Cooper.He also predicts a coming health-care revolution via wireless devices such as \"smart\" clothing that will measure our functions round-the-clock.\"If we can sense a few cancer cells or a virus before your body starts getting damaged, we can target and eliminate those things,\" he says. \"That's one way wireless technology will allow us to live perhaps not longer, but much healthier lives.\"Sound far-fetched?So did the cell phone.Dyna LLC:\"Meet Marty Cooper, the Forefather of Your Cell Phone\": https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/hello-world-marty-cooper-the-father-of-the-cell-phone/55ba3fdc9820ecc47f68c32b"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/smarter-smart-phone", "content": "According to Consumer Reports, 3.1 million cell phones were stolen in the United States in 2013.When phones are stolen, often more than just the device is compromised; personal identities, private information, and pride of the owner are also at risk (just ask insert-name-of-shamed-celebrity-here).Sure, we can activate numerically coded screen locks, but locks offer only one layer of protection-and as any thief will attest, locks were meant to be broken. What's more, locking functions may not activate before a thief gains access. And it doesn't need to be a thief. Even if we willingly lend our phone to, say, a friend who needs to make a call, we may not want our friend to have access to our online-banking apps or those embarrassing photos on Facebook.IIT computer science doctoral student Cheng Bo is developing a new method of protection that uses equipment already built into smart phones in a different way to add a new layer of protection-through biometrics that allow cell phones to identify their owners by the way users touch or tap a screen.Bo has written a machine-learning algorithm, dubbed SilentSense, that teaches existing phones to recognize their users' phone-handling patterns-from their grips and pressure of contact to finger size and the angles at which they hold their phones. His software works alongside the accelerometers and motion sensors already in cell phones, enabling phones to recognize owners with 99 percent accuracy. If the phone doesn't know its user, it locks itself entirely.Bo explains that SilentSense teaches phones to identify owners based on two patterns of use. \"The first is how you hold and touch the phone. There is a correlation between the location that you press and the vibration [in relationship to the location of the motion sensor]. The second is when you touch the phone the device reacts. We can capture that reaction. Then we link the two together to teach the machine how to learn,\" Bo says.\"You, only you, can make the phone act like that,\" he adds. \"Even if someone knows how you hold or touch a phone, they cannot know the strength of your touch.\"Bo says that the newest security options on some phones allow owners to deactivate certain apps so that other users who may borrow the phones cannot access these apps. But unlike SilentSense, which knows automatically how to recognize another user, these newer options require the owner to perform an additional manual selection.Bo presented his project at the mobile computing and networking conference ACM MobiCom 2013 in Miami and plans to do additional work to make SilentSense even more accurate. In the meantime, he continues to field calls from companies, especially security companies, about how to implement SilentSense into their own products. He is currently working on new software that can override built-in GPS systems in smart phones to more accurately identify locations within critical regions-such as metropolises, where GPS can have poor accuracy-as well as on software that will lock or silence a cell phone if the user is driving."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe-1886-1969", "content": "According to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's obituary in the, S.

Early in 2014, he and mentor Antony Wood, IIT research professor and executive director of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), launched \"A Study of the Sustainability Implications of Differing Urban + Suburban Locations in Chicago.\" The objective of this first phase of their joint project is to provide a better understanding of the factors that contribute to sustainability (energy/carbon expenditure, mobility, infrastructure, and quality of life) in two different communities: three high-rise units in downtown Chicago and one of the city's collar suburbs, Oak Park.In addition to collecting the data from the public resources, building designers, and building management, Du and Wood created a survey and a questionnaire asking participants to provide such information as demographics, household type, residential type, mode of transportation and travel behavior during a typical week, monthly utility usage, land-use characteristics, satisfaction with residential life, and sustainable living behavior. Approximately 200 households in both the tower and low-rise or single-family dwellings have participated. The duo is now in the process of analyzing the data gathered.\"With United Nations statistics indicating that almost one million people are becoming urbanized every week, the debate on whether our cities should develop along dispersed suburban-horizontal or dense urban-vertical directions is at the very heart of sustainability and our continued survival on this planet,\" says Wood, also a visiting professor of tall buildings at Tongji University in Shanghai, China. \"Yet no one has actually done detailed research to investigate the full carbon and lifestyle implications of living in high-rise or low-rise buildings. This research project could thus hardly be more important, and looks to fill a massive research gap internationally.\"Prior to studying and working in Chicago, Du obtained his Master of Architecture at Tongji University, which has a leading architecture school in Asia, and began earning design and urban best practices awards as far back as 2006. He is currently a CTBUH research assistant, studio instructor, and operations coordinator for CTBUH Asia Headquarters, the 2012 and 2014 CTBUH Shanghai conferences, and CTBUH Skyscraper Center efforts.A resident of Bronzeville's South Commons high-rise development and regular user of the Divvy bike-sharing system, Du is looking forward to implementing his vision for the city at the completion of the study in 2016, when he and Wood plan to present their findings and recommend guidelines for increasing a city's density.\"Peng has tackled this study with an enthusiasm and diligence befitting the project-knowing he was breaking new and important ground-with IIT and the IIT-based CTBUH in support,\" says Wood.Architectural Research Centers Consortium: www.arccweb.orgCouncil on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/cyber-security-and-forensics-through-decades", "content": "A good intuition, dedication to problem solving, and an ability to detect the next big thing\u2014never mind technological wizardry\u2014are all in the toolbox of a serious computing sleuth like Bill Lidinsky (EE '61, M.S. '70).Lidinsky, industry professor and director of IIT School of Applied Technology's Computer Security\u00a0and Forensics Laboratory, developed and honed much of his cyber security and cyber forensics expertise at IIT. Over the past four decades, he has become a leader in several areas of computer networking and security, and is regularly called upon to testify as an expert witness for government agencies on such matters.spoke with Lidinsky about three areas where he has made\u2014and continues to make\u2014a mark throughout the years.While at Bell Laboratories and Fermilab, Lidinsky and members of a committee developed the spanning-tree system standard that is now used in almost every computer-network router throughout the world. They devised the standard for a modem, router, and computer to communicate and set up automatically. This system is used to set up all Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks today\"There's a negotiation that goes on that allows users to 'plug and play,' meaning consumers don't have to configure much, a password at most,\" Lidinsky explains.Lidinsky worked with Bell colleagues who designed, developed, and built the first metropolitan-area computer network, or MAN, in the 1970s. At the time, personal computers did not exist; instead, individuals used time-sharing systems that connected to a mainframe computer. Workstations, now known as personal computers, were emerging. These workstations in different parts of a metropolitan area could not easily communicate with each other, so Lidinsky developed networks that would cover an entire city and support workstations, based on an idea similar to a telephone system.The origins of Lidinsky's current area of expertise, steganography, can be found in ancient Greece. The fifth-century B.C. historian Herodotus left an account of the tyrant Histiaeus, whoshaved the head of a slave, tattooed a message on it, let the slave's hair grow back, and sent him to Histiaeus's friend Aristagoras to warn him of impending danger. Hiding the covert in the overt\u2014so outsiders are unaware not only of what is being communicated but that any communication even exists\u2014is the heart of steganography.Spies and terrorists want to be able to communicate with each other but not to identify each other, so they utilize a steganographic technique known as a dead drop. One spy, for example, would know to look on eBay for a particular item with a photo so that they could download the photo and then retrieve the message. The spies never know or see each other but are still able to communicate valuable information.At IIT, Lidinsky has researched how to hide information in image, video, and audio files. He has also investigated steganalysis\u2014how to know whether covert information has been hidden in a file or not, and how to extract it if it's there. While there is currently no general method to determine whether seemingly innocent files have covert information that could be extracted, Ben Khodja, Lidinsky's graduate student, has found a way to gauge the probability that an MP3 file may contain a covert message.\"You don't want to waste time looking for something that isn't there,\" says Lidinsky, \"but you do want to spend time looking for information that could be potentially valuable.\"IIT School of Applied Technology:\"Trends in Steganography\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/highly-charged-life", "content": "It was a scene that could have been out of a James Bond flick. A man knew he had been selected to participate in a top-secret mission and was given a train ticket to Chicago's Union Station.Once at the station, he was to make a telephone call for instructions. The voice at the other end of the phone told the man to stand in a certain area of the station holding a newspaper under his left arm. He would then be approached by another man, who would ask him if he were waiting for someone to pick him up. If his response was \"yes,\" the man with the newspaper was to give his companion a designated telephone number, which was the password to their final destination, place unknown to the man with the newspaper.That man was Harris Harold Levee (ME '49), who, in 1945, was sent from his post as a United States Army private at Fort Belvoir, Va., to Chicago to assist on a government mission so significant that he would not even be able to contact his family while he was on it. As Levee found out, he was on his way to the University of Chicago to work on the government's research effort to produce the first atomic bombs: the Manhattan Project.\"I'm 95 years old and I guess that I am as patriotic as it's possible to be because I was willing to do whatever was necessary for our country,\" says the spry nonagenarian, in a phone interview from his home in Gaithersburg, Md. \"I didn't know if I was going to become full of radiation, but I did it anyway.\"Levee was selected for the Manhattan Project because he had trained as a combat engineer once drafted by the Army and had achieved very high scores on a mechanical aptitude test. He was commissioned to serve as an engineer and was also responsible for maintaining project secrecy and obtaining project patent rights from scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard. Levee recalls that Fermi was easy to get along with but that Szilard was one tough but brilliant character. Initially, Szilard did not wish to relinquish his patent rights, so Levee made a bold suggestion to his boss, Lieutenant Colonel Herbert E. Metcalf: Don't pay Szilard until he does so.\"I don't know if that's what they did,\" he says with a gleeful giggle. \"But a few weeks later, Szilard signed his papers.\"While being a member of the A-bomb team may have been the high point of his life, Levee says there are other high points, such as his consulting role for the building of the first air-transportable nuclear power plant to Antarctica and his supervisory role on the construction of the model of the world's first operational nuclear-powered submarine, the.\"I remember that the father of the nuclear submarine [popularly known as the \"Father of the Nuclear Navy\"], Admiral Rickover [U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman G. Rickover], visited the plant and was supposed to be the first one to start the nuclear submarine,\" says Levee. \"I convinced the general manager that I should be the one to see if it would, in fact, start. So I turned on the nuclear reactor, it worked, and I turned it right off, putting the control rods immediately back in so that Rickover could start it and let it run.\"Levee says his most fulfilling high point took place in India, where he supervised the construction of several coal-fired electric-generating stations in New Delhi and Takhar in the early 1960s.\"We used medieval equipment\u2014and when I say medieval, I mean medieval\u2014using shovels and hoes, and mixing cement by hand,\" explains Levee. \"To build these stations, we used about 50 tribal women to carry bowls of cement and concrete blocks on their heads, who then walked up an incline plank to dump the cement into a container. It was remarkable and absolutely amazing for someone from the United States to see and to supervise. When they fed their babies breast milk, they had to go underneath our construction site to do so.\"As much as Levee relished his consulting projects, in 1967 he responded to an advertisement in thethat he felt described him perfectly. A few weeks later, he accepted a position with Norair Engineering, Inc. as vice president and resigned from the company seven years later to form his own company, Halco Engineering, Inc.Now, Levee spends his days reading theand relaxing with his wife, Pearl, who accompanied him to India for his engineering projects. He says that even though he came to IIT after his work on the Manhattan Project, the knowledge he received at the university added to the significance of his engineering career.\"Besides the fact that I enjoyed the teachers, who were very good, one of them, Bill Goodman, taught a graduate course in air-conditioning that I used because I eventually entered into such a business [Halco],\" he says. \"That course ended up being very instrumental in my future life.\"Harris Harold Levee, interview by Cynthia C.

The design architect for the building that will house the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship, Ronan creates works that are elegant pieces of art and design as well as practical, well-constructed buildings that enhance communities rather than merely ego statements.A professor at IIT College of Architecture, he is the founding principal of John Ronan Architects. Established in 1999, the firm rose to national prominence in 2004 with the winning design for the\u00a0500,000-square-foot Perth Amboy High School\u00a0in New Jersey. His firm received two American Institute of Architects (AIA) Institute National Honor Awards, for the Poetry Foundation and the Gary Comer Youth Center, both in Chicago. In 2010, Princeton Architectural Press published a monograph entitled. The firm's work has also been displayed in galleries and exhibitions such as Iterations: John Ronan's Poetry Foundation, shown at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2013\u201314.met with this Chicago high-crafter to discuss a wide range of topics-from statement buildings to which architects would make the most interesting dinner guests.How a building connects with people on an emotional level is one of the most important aspects of architectural design, and I don't think it comes at the expense of function but resides in how you handle the most fundamental questions of building design. How do I enter? How do I move from floor to floor? How is the structure handled? Too much emphasis today is placed on imagery and form, and as a result too many buildings strive to be, which leads to the worst kind of excesses. My interest is to design buildings that will be.It depends who you are being compared to [laughs]. I suppose it's always flattering to be mentioned in the same sentence as Mies, an architect whose work I admire greatly and who remains relevant today. My work is about fundamental issues of building-space, material, structure-and doesn't look outside of the discipline for validation, so in that way I can see the affinity. But there are other architects whose work has been more influential for me such as Eero Saarinen, for example.It varies. Some buildings are instant classics while others prove themselves to be so in retrospect. Unfortunately, the term \"iconic\" has now become rather indiscriminately applied to any building that exhibits some kind of formal exuberance, which only encourages further self-expression and object making. This trend is leaving a legacy of self-referential \"object\" buildings, which refer to nothing except their authors' egos, which impoverishes our collective urban space. Our definition of iconic needs to change, and perhaps IIT can play an instrumental part in that change.It's important to distinguish between different kinds of drawing and model making. The drawings or sketch models I do at the beginning of a project are done as a means of thinking. Later drawings and models, whether digital or by hand, tend to be more about communication-to the owner, the builder, the community-that explains the design and the arguments behind it. I don't privilege hand drawing over digital tools, but I do privilege speed, and it is simply faster to draw by hand at the beginning of the process to develop ideas; a computer forces a precision on the project that is unmerited at that early stage and just slows the process down.I am not interested in developing a signature style, but there is a similar sensibility at work in all the projects-whether they be institutional, commercial, or residential-and also similar themes operating in each, such as the approach to materials, the spatial layering, and the importance of natural light. But I think design should be anonymous, in a way, and not constantly referring back to its author; so if someone walks into a building and immediately says my name, then that isn't necessarily a good thing.John Soane, Sigurd Lewerentz, Eero Saarinen.

What a mistake.)"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2015/getting-grip", "content": "In the 1960s, \"The Jetsons\" cartoon creators Hanna-Barbera imagined the outer-space robot housekeeper of the future as Rosie, a sassy didactyl who was mostly successful at keeping the Jetson family's Orbit City apartment tidy.Today, truth is arguably just as strange as fiction-considering an inspiration for the engineering behind real twenty-first-century robots able to clean up space debris comes from an unlikely place: the forests of southeast Asia.Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Matthew Spenko and his research team at the IIT Robotics Lab have taken cues from the Asian gecko lizard in their development of a surveillance robot that can climb up and perch on vertical surfaces. NASA hopes the mechanism that enables this robot's adhesive-like gripping ability can be used with robots designed to remove space junk from low Earth orbit.\"In space there is no suction, and magnetized surfaces can't be guaranteed,\" Spenko says, noting that traditional methods of adhesion are ineffective there. \"A typical approach would then be to design a robot that could attach to grapple points on debris. But much of the debris, such as satellites, don't have grapple points, making it difficult to grasp.\"NASA estimates that 21,000 pieces of debris (10 cm or larger) are circling Earth, with upwards of 100 million smaller pieces in orbit. In November 2014, NASA controllers raised the orbit of the International Space Station by one mile to avoid the near trajectory of a defunct, junked satellite.Spenko and his team are researching whether the innovative combination of gecko-like adhesives and electrostatic electrodes that compose their robot's gripping mechanism could be a debris-remediation solution that sticks. Part engineering and part biomimicry, this mechanism employs what is known as dry adhesion. It involves joining a molded material containing nano-sized hairs-much like the beta keratin setae on the feet of geckos, which are especially adept at gripping smooth surfaces-with charged electrodes whose polarized electrostatic fields create a force that enables the gripping of rough surfaces.Used alone, the nano-hairs or the electrodes are limited in the types of surfaces they can attach to. Combined, they result in a gripping mechanism that is not surface dependent and able to hold seven times the robot's body weight. Spenko says that these grippers also have potential applications in manufacturing, such as on factory lines-anyplace where a better gripping tool might surpass outdated machines.A focus of Spenko's Robotics Lab is building robots that achieve mobility in challenging environments, which makes unwieldy surfaces like space junk right up the team's alley. The team developed HyTAQ, a teleoperated robot that is capable of both flying and rolling over rough terrain (a toy version of the robot is now available on Amazon), and conducts research on how wheeled robots move over various types of soil. The group is currently working with ComEd to develop robots that can supply remote monitoring in areas with unknown terrain.IIT Robotics Lab:Matthew Spenko Audio Extra:NASA Orbital Debris Program Office:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/media/intersection-humanities-and-technology", "content": "Listen to Associate Professor Matthew Spenko's take on this in an IIT Magazine Audio Extra.Remember.

The office recently netted a $60,000 recycling grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to upgrade trash compactors on Main Campus, which will reduce the university's waste-hauling costs. Through the annual student class gift, the Office of Institutional Advancement obtained OCES funding for 19 new bicycle racks this fall, increasing on-campus storage capacity by 35 percent. The student gift also funded two new bicycle fix-it stations each featuring an air pump and basic tools, doubling the number of fix-it stations on campus. And emissions coordinator Pepper says IIT has become a go-to school on energy rebates offered by ComEd and other utility companies.\"We've utilized tens of thousands of dollars in energy rebates and have had other universities approach us with the question-'How are you guys doing this so well?' he says. \"So we've been helping them discover the ways that they could be getting this money to upgrade their lighting fixtures, steam traps, and more.\"Besides relying on a dedicated core team of innovative student-workers, Manly says that students enrolled incan be a great resource for brainstorming real-world issues right on campus. He notes that one IPRO group laid the foundation for OCES's parking lot paver recommendation.\"The stormwater project that former IIT College of Architecture Studio Assistant Professor Mary Pat Matson and Associate Professor of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering Paul Anderson spearheaded was essential in our plans for the parking lot,\" Manly explains. \"Their IPRO class last summer explored ways to implement stormwater management across campus.

STE '08), are working to keep the Nicaraguan students on dry land as often as possible through a bridge construction project coordinated through EWB-USA and Boston-based FriendsNE. The bridge is being planned to span a \"river\" that appears during the rainy season, a period that runs from May through December, and will assist some 3,000 residents, including the children who must sometimes swim to class.While actual bridge building has not yet begun, the EWB-IIT group has laid a strong foundation for the project, which will run through fall 2017. Through two assessments conducted in Nicaragua over the 2013 and 2014 spring breaks, EWB-IIT members learned that the water that pools during the rainy season is, in fact, a much more expansive floodplain than first anticipated and that building the bridge may not solve the real issue.\"At the point where the local rivers meet, a large amount of sediment and debris has piled up causing upstream flooding,\" explains Lewan, noting that a channel cut into the floodplain would decrease the width of the water and the resulting length of the bridge. \"The reason such a wide body of water forms is that the water can't drain.\"This year, EWB-IIT members submitted six bridge designs to the San Claudio community and are awaiting the results of local hydrologic studies before deciding which design to utilize. Lewan and Freisinger, both structural engineers at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (), introduced the IIT students to bridge codes and loads specific to Nicaragua as well as the types of construction materials suitable for that part of the world before dividing them into six design teams.\"One of the students came up with a floating bridge idea that was worth exploring,\" says Freisinger. \"The students actually came up with cost estimates for each of the bridges and had the document translated into Spanish. They also made flip binders for distribution to the group in Nicaragua.\"Freisinger, named a 2014 Outstanding Young Engineer of the Year by the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois, and Lewan, who nominated his colleague for the award, have both been involved in EWB-IIT for two years and believe it is a natural progression of their positive experiences as IIT students. They tag-team the chapter-mentoring and technical-mentoring duties year-round, and have agreed to serve with EWB-IIT through 2017, even working with members on other potential San Claudio projects, including clean water filtration and improved cook-stove ventilation.\"We are both impressed by the IIT chapter. The students do a really good job at making this a priority while doing their coursework and extracurricular activities, even through midterms and final exams; it's refreshing to work with students who are so interested in learning and who want to make the world a better place,\" Freisinger explains. \"This is what I enjoy most from my mentorship. I'm happy to be helping the people of Nicaragua, but I'm also helping to develop students into amazing leaders.\"One of these leaders is EWB-IIT Director of Projects Cara Karter (SEDP 3rd year), who conducted a baseline community study of residents' needs in San Claudio.\"It was humbling for me to hear about their problems and needs, and to realize how much our presence in San Claudio has an impact on them,\" says Karter, who learned about the children swimming to school during her conversations with the residents. \"What will stay with me was seeing mothers universally caring about their children and wanting to see a better future for them.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/summer-real-research-0", "content": "Aerospace Engineering/4th yearThe Effect of Initial Microstructure on Dynamic Re-Crystallization of 4140 SteelAssociate Professor Sammy TinWays to improve the performance and structural properties of advanced metallic alloys, like 4140 steel, which are used in the automotive and aerospace industries.

So when the Pakistani-born son of a professional cricket player arrived at IIT, the first thing he noticed was the sport's absence.\"I saw we had all of these other sports-basketball, baseball, soccer-so why not cricket?\" he says. \"I've always loved playing cricket and for me, it is life. I don't think I could survive without it.\"Khaliqdina and 20 of his peers petitioned to form the IIT Cricket Club and in 2010 the intramural sport and the Scarlet Hawks cricket team became reality. Today the club boasts more than 150 members, about a third of whom started playing cricket for the first time through the club's annual spring tournament.The Keating Premier League is an eight-week indoor cricket tournament held annually in IIT's Keating Sports Center. The games are played on a smaller court using tennis balls in place of the harder, traditional cricket ball. Eighteen teams and 145 students participated in the 2014 tournament, attesting to the sport's growing popularity on campus.\"The club hosts the tournament on campus to get people to come out, get to know cricket, get the chance to play, and to have fun doing it,\" says Khaliqdina. \"Also, a lot of students get introduced to the sport by watching us play.\"For Travon Cooman (BCHM, '14), the club brought recreation and balance to his rigorous academic schedule.\"The curriculum at IIT can be really challenging sometimes and you need a break. Playing cricket helped me to direct my energy, and gave me time to relax and do something apart from studying,\" Cooman says.Popular in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia, the sport is slowly gaining traction in the United States. Similar to baseball, cricket actually predates America's homegrown game in U.S. sports history. According to the, colonists played the game as early as 1737 and continued to do so after the nation's independence from England. Now, more than 50 leagues exist nationwide and the Scarlet Hawks play in one of them: the Midwest Cricket Conference.The MCC comprises teams from Chicago and the surrounding area as well as teams from Milwaukee and Madison, Wis., and St. Louis. The league offers players the chance to participate at a higher, more competitive level.Despite being newcomers in 2010, the IIT Scarlet Hawks ended their first league season in fourth place and in the years that followed, they consistently made it to the playoffs.Khaliqdina attributes the club's success to the passionate commitment of the players and the support of the campus community. Faculty, staff, and fellow students promote the club through word of mouth and by posting fliers about the club's tournament and the Hawks' league competitions.Although the club's founding members have all graduated, cricket has definitely come to stay at IIT-a fact that pleases Khaliqdina.\"More and more of the students who come for master's degrees at IIT come from places where cricket is really big. In coming to the U.S., they think the sport is over for them,\" he says. \"So when they see we have cricket here, it's like regaining a lost love.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/research-engineering", "content": "In the 1960s, \"The Jetsons\" cartoon creators Hanna-Barbera imagined the outer-space robot housekeeper of the future as Rosie, a sassy didactyl who was mostly successful at keeping the Jetson family's Orbit City apartment tidy.

Peter Matic (ME '77) of the United States Naval Research Laboratory is working to relate blast pressure impacts to the motion of the brain and changes in neuronal cells.\"We want to bridge the gap between the engineering and medical fields by gaining a better understanding of injury processes and the way personal protective equipment performs,\" says Matic, superintendent of the Materials Science and Technology Division at NRL.In standard crash test dummies, a metallic model of the human head with a rubber coating and sensors mounted to the interior is used to measure accelerations from blunt impact. In contrast, Matic and his team wanted to focus on soft tissue and skeletal structures for the blast pressure. Matic proposed to simulate the likeness of a brain using soft polymers and an array of embedded sensors. They called him GelMan.To build GelMan, Matic's colleague Amit Bagchi, who also has a background in mechanical engineering, worked on the design, fabrication, and testing strategies. Chris Kindle, also a mechanical engineer, used a mold from an anatomical model of the brain, and then filled that mold with a polymer. While casting the brain, sensors were embedded that measure pressure and acceleration. The brain was then placed inside the polymer skull, mounted on a neck component, and applied with soft coatings on top to simulate skin.Thomas O'Shaughnessy, a neuroscientist, brought expertise in cellular-level work to measure what percentage of cells survive in the hours and days after a blast. The team quantified how a cell would respond to blast pressures and discovered that cells die off at a faster rate if exposed to certain levels of blast.Matic's research team specifically measures how the brain responds to primary blast pressure. They are also interested in the effect of blast fragments, so they analyze high-speed video of fragments, track shockwaves hitting the target, and measure the relative motion of the protective equipment and the body.\"This type of research, data, and technology provides a more complete description of blast, ballistic, and blunt impact,\" Matic says. \"We want to optimize equipment and continually improve performance.\"Research coming out of NRL provides information that helps the U.S. Marine Corps make decisions based upon quantitative data that describes how different equipment performs.\"The entrepreneurial environment at NRL allows us to do basic research that transitions into the applied realm and provides the Navy, Marine Corps, and Department of Defense with superior technologies,\" Matic says. \"It's a good place for collaboration between the disciplines needed to solve challenging problems.\"U.S. Department of Defense Special Report on Traumatic Brain Injury:United States Naval Research Laboratory:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/urban-development", "content": "His work has been compared to that of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and now IIT College of Architecture Professor John Ronan is providing his design aesthetic to the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship, to be built on IIT Main Campus.Choosing to be an architect was Peng Du's means to an end, rather than being his life goal.

It aims to improve the reliability, security, and affordability of energy and water byOur strategy recognizes that an effective national pathway to sustainability must include three plans (short-term, transitional, and long-term) that must be launched simultaneously.Short-term plans must address our nation's immediate need for energy supplies, materials, and water as well as efficient and smart usage and conservation. The short-term strategy must also include the:Transitional plans should address the shift from the present stage to the desired long-term goal of a society powered by sustainable energy using natural gas (with a lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio) as the main transitional fuel. The plan should incorporate major infrastructural change and investment in both electricity and gas grids, which will include large-scale energy-storage facilities to accommodate conditions in which the major component of electricity is being produced using renewable-energy sources.The plan should also include coordination between critical infrastructures (electricity, telecommunications, natural gas, and water), cybersecurity, and enhancement of infrastructure resilience in adverse conditions. In addition, a continuous increase in research and development activity is needed for production of natural gas (using environmentally acceptable fracturing or other technologies) from gas hydrates and low-permeability reserves such as shale formations. Abundant supplies of natural gas from unconventional reserves currently afford us a unique window of opportunity to invest in comprehensive fundamental and applied research and development initiatives in renewable energy, energy storage, water, and infrastructure of the electricity, gas, and water grids that are necessary for the implementation of a successful long-term energy strategy.An effective long-term plan should address major and comprehensive basic and applied research and development initiatives in renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal), large- and small-scale energy-storage facilities, and integration of renewable-energy supplies with the electricity grid. The long-term plan should also demand life-cycle analysis of materials and national water and carbon-based fuels consumption policies.In addition, educational, outreach, and research programs should be launched to educate the general public not only about advances in science and engineering but also about applications in urban systems, changes in human behavior, and economic and policy analyses.Managing our nation's successful transition to sustainable energy will require the development and implementation of a comprehensive and multitiered energy and sustainability policy formulated in collaboration with the key stakeholders including government, industry, and academia.

Beyond his academic endeavors, Luis has been working on several exciting real-world projects as part of his IIT education.One product of his work-a Web-based dashboard for the Chicago Police Department-helps police to monitor crime information in the Windy City. Larco's work is part of a larger Predictive Policing project, conducted under the supervision of Professor Miles Wernick at the Illinois Institute of Technology's, in which concepts from medical imaging are used in the development of computer algorithms that analyze and predict crime. The project has produced several crime-prediction capabilities, one of which involves prediction of tomorrow's level of crime activity based on numerous factors. Larco has translated this and other algorithmic data into a user-friendly website that can guide police officers when they assess variables in crime patterns on any given beat.As Larco explains, \"A certain number of crime events happen every day in each part of the city. Police officers often know what to expect, but if they see a spike in robberies, they will know that this is not normal.\" One feature of the dashboard is that it will allow a police commander to review the data from prior days to see if something that is taking place in that moment is unusual and then make adjustments, such as directing more officers to an area that may be in need.The CPD will begin using the system this fall once the beta-testing phase is complete.Larco and Wernick are both engineers wanting to make an impact on real-world problems. Wernick explains that \"IIT's Medical Imaging Research Center has been focused on developing tools to improve health care, and it has been very rewarding to apply our experience in this area to assist law enforcement agencies with new tools to fight crime.\"Larco echoes Wernick's sentiments: \"When I think of engineering, I always try to think about what the needs of my community and the world are, and how I can make a change. That's one of the things that grabbed my attention about this project.\" He adds, \"Chicago has been having a lot of issues with crime. What can I do to help? That is a big incentive for me to spend nights and weekends working on the project.\"The CPD dashboard is one of three projects in Larco's recent portfolio of activities.

The superconducting magnets developed and produced for the first time on an industrial scale for Fermilab's Tevatron now find common use in magnetic resonance imaging scanners. Novel imaging techniques beyond old-fashioned photographic emulsions are common in medical diagnostics and surgery. The World Wide Web was created at CERN so that scientists in global collaborations could work together more effectively. Thus, the overall goal of scientific discovery has motivated and underwritten the development of new technologies of enormous benefit to us all.Beyond the \"what\" of scientific discovery and the \"how\" of the technologies needed to accomplish the goals, a third and perhaps most important piece of the enterprise is the \"who\"\u2014the people.Vannevar Bush, celebrated American engineer and science administrator, characterized scientific research in his seminal report \"Science\u2014the Endless Frontier\" and cast the enterprise as one of exploration and discovery, one that can motivate and inspire those individuals who engage in it. They are challenged by the unknown and by problems for which there are no clear solutions. So, in addition to the knowledge gained, this research becomes a kind of gymnasium for the mind where intellectual muscles and problem-solving skill sets are developed.The participants in this enterprise, particularly students, have shown time and time again how the skills they have developed can be applied in many diverse areas outside science itself. They bring together critical and logical thinking with analytical, communication, and collaborative ability so necessary in the world today. Examples of successes are to be found in the worlds of computers and data science, in energy and climate science, in business and finance, in the arts and music, and even in politics and government. This, I believe, is the biggest payoff of all."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/my-college-education-worth-having", "content": "Akinade Aderele, a fourth-year architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology, views a college education as a down payment on a long-term investment in the future of his home country.A native of Lagos, the most populous city in Nigeria and the largest in Africa, Aderele misses home, but says his decision to leave his homeland to travel nearly 6,000 miles to the United States was a good one. With Chicago being known for its architecture and its connection to some of architecture's most important trailblazers, such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Aderele says it was important that he come here.\"It is one of the biggest and best urban labs in which to study architecture,\" says Aderele, president of the IIT Student Government Association.But for Aderele, his decision to attend Illinois Tech goes much deeper than personal gain. He believes that a college education is the bedrock supporting a nation's economic prosperity, especially in countries like Nigeria that are struggling to gain solid economic footing. For many Nigerians, the decision to travel abroad to gain that education is becoming increasingly popular due to current challenges that exist in the Nigerian higher-education system.\"The major problems are due to public strikes and university strikes, some of which could extend the duration of a student's stay in the university by up to two years,\" Aderele explains. \"The second reason is that the overall quality of education is not on par with American universities.\"Aderele maintains that society can thrive most effectively through the efforts of its educated citizens.\"Any major advances made by countries are the result of a focus on education. I would like to hope that an investment in education may eventually save countries like my own,\" he says. \"The cost of a college education is higher than it has ever been before, and this reason among others, such as accessibility to information through the Internet, has caused people to question the relevancy of a college education. In some cases this may be true, but for most people the stepping-stone of a college education in the context of future success is invaluable.\"Influenced by his own childhood in Nigeria and many of the struggles he witnessed firsthand, Aderele plans to use his college education to design and manage urban-renewal projects that focus on developing housing and infrastructure for those living in poverty with little access to electricity, plumbing, and other basic conveniences.That goal\u2014paired with his parents'\u00a0gentle encouragement to give back to his country with the education and experience he has gained in the U.S.\u2014is Aderele's daily motivation. He also thinks of his younger sister who is majoring in industrial engineering at Drexel University and who wants to return to Nigeria. The two siblings share the same desire to improve the living conditions there.\"My dream is to use my college education to help Nigeria become a better country,\" he says. \"Looking at it economically, since my parents and many others have invested so much in my education in the United States, I want to be able to pay those dividends back home. I look at my country and the African continent, and I see the potential that they have. Why not use my education to make improvements and harness that massive potential?\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/textbook-obsolete", "content": "Joy Kubarek-Sandor has worked at John G. Shedd Aquarium since 2006 and oversees the Shedd's Learning Group. Her team provides a range of learning experiences onsite, offsite, and online with the goal of enhancing a learner's scientific literacy, environmental literacy, and twenty-first-century learning skills. Read more about Kubarek-Sandor at www.sheddaquarium.org/Learning-Experiences/Learning-Experts/Joy-Kubarek-Sandor.The science-learning landscape is shifting. As information becomes more readily available, learning environments become transformed with the help of technology and individuals take more ownership of their education in and out of the classroom. For example, the Maker Movement has helped the act of doing science and engineering become more accessible and achievable for a wider range of individuals. To make can mean to try and to fail, and to learn from those failures as one continues in the making process. Such lessons are seldom taught in the classroom, but informal science settings such as Maker Faires, museums, and youth-driven media spaces broaden this new perspective of how one learns.The science-learning landscape is moving from an emphasis on knowledge transfer from experts and textbooks to generating one's own knowledge through firsthand experiences and experimentation. This is not to say that the classroom experience is no longer relevant. Rather, this is a time for informal science settings to rise to the occasion to meet the needs of learners through their unique offerings and resources.At Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, an array of programs strives to help learners become more confident and competent in engaging with science and the environment. The Asian Carp Exploration Curriculum for seventh through ninth grades allows students to explore the complex issues surrounding such aquatic invasive species as Asian carp in the Great Lakes. Using science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) principles, students take on multiple stakeholder perspectives and propose plausible solutions to this real-world problem.The Teen Learning Lab is a dynamic, flexible learning space for teens to explore their interests around science and the environment. Utilizing a connected-learning framework (Ito et al., 2013), this space fosters peer-supported, interest-powered, and academic-oriented learning activities for teens from across the Chicago area. Teens use an array of technology including Apple MacBooks and iPads, podcasting equipment, scanners, SmartBoards, and Adobe software suites to generate their work. They may also use a 3-D printer to model an addition to an animal habitat or program and Minecraft to create their own online games about marine-protected areas.Finally, Shedd's Summer Road Trip teaches youth about their local ecosystems by immersing them in that environment and integrating technology to further question and investigate the natural phenomena. For instance, participants use iPads to conduct ethograms on animal behavior so they may better understand the animal's role in the ecosystem and the challenges animals face.These programs extend the learning that happens in the classroom, bringing the textbook alive and providing rich opportunities for learners to further develop their understanding of science concepts and processes. True to the core of IIT's mathematics and science education department, many of these programs hold up the tenets of the nature of science and science inquiry; they emphasize collaboration and creativity, questioning and investigation, observations and inference, and making informed decisions based on evidence. Informal science-education experiences such as these will be critical as the learning landscape continues to shift and education extends beyond the four walls of the classroom. It is truly the union of informal and formal learning that will best prepare the next generation of global citizens and informed decision-makers."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/research", "content": "IIT-educated scientist Peter Matic and his team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory put their heads together to gain a better understanding of how personal protective equipment can effectively shield military personnel from traumatic brain injury due to blast impacts."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/blast-injury", "content": "IIT-educated scientist Peter Matic and his team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory put their heads together to gain a better understanding of how personal protective equipment can effectively shield military personnel from traumatic brain injury due to blast impacts."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/brain", "content": "IIT-educated scientist Peter Matic and his team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory put their heads together to gain a better understanding of how personal protective equipment can effectively shield military personnel from traumatic brain injury due to blast impacts."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/creative-path-leadership", "content": "Christine Himes's path to dean of IIT Lewis College of Human Sciences was a wild ride\u2014unpredictable, nonlinear, and filled with surprising twists. Over the course of her life, Himes has found one constant: pursuing her fascinations, no matter how circuitous and rudderless her career journey sometimes has seemed. She has taken risks and exemplified other qualities noted in highly creative individuals, seeking out new experiences and connecting the dots in seemingly unrelated situations, as she has followed her interests\u2014and discovered her passions.One of eight children, the Chesterton, Ind., native says that she was a good student in high school but did not receive much guidance about how to choose a college or a course of study. She thought she might want to apply to law school or medical school one day and, liking science, chose chemistry as her major. She instead graduated from Purdue University with a B.A. in Russian language and a B.S. in industrial management, the latter because she was interested in economics. After working as a purchasing agent for a cereal toy packager and as a fiscal analyst for the Indiana General Assembly, Himes entered into a graduate mathematics program.While at Purdue, Himes saw a promotional poster about demography and decided to enroll in one of the few demography doctoral programs in the country at that time, at the University of Pennsylvania, which \"turned out to be the perfect fit.\" With a second doctorate in sociology, Himes embarked on a 19-year career at Syracuse University, where she served as chair and Maxwell Professor of Sociology as well as director of the Center for Policy Research at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. At the center, Himes fostered a creative environment through interdisciplinary collaboration and contributed to the establishment of the Aging Studies Institute.The daughter of a retired electrical engineer and the mother of an aerospace engineer, Himes says that she already \"feels very much at home\" at IIT. She shares some thoughts about creativity here and in anVideo Extra atdiscusses how the intersection of humanities and technology can inspire creativity.I was attracted to apply because this is a new college. I like the fact that it is interdisciplinary almost by nature. Gerontology and demography, my two areas of study, are both interdisciplinary. I like the size of IIT, which allows people to do more creative things. You can go right over and talk to the person because there aren't as many layers of bureaucracy as found at larger institutions.I also like the idea of emphasizing the social and the behavioral sciences within a technology environment. We spend a lot of time thinking about how to train people to develop new technology; we have to spend some time thinking about what the implications of that technology are on our lives. How can technology be a useful tool to us?The combination of identifying what societal problems we want to address and drawing upon technology as a way to solve those problems is our future.To be creative, one needs certain tools and skills, which can certainly be taught. People can be taught to think differently; that's the way to come up with new solutions. But can you teach someone to have a particular way of thinking? I don't think so. You can't change people's underlying tendencies toward what they're good at or the way that they think, but you can give them skills that will allow them to tap into the parts of their brain that they may not always use.Fear of failure, I think, is the biggest stumbling block to creativity. Sometimes young people can be more creative because they're less afraid of making a mistake. Another stumbling block is that people have ideas but don't know what to do with them. People are much more creative than we know, but they don't have a good way of communicating those ideas or putting them into practice. Another set of skills is required to make ideas known and meaningful. Establishing environments such as IIT's new innovation center and business incubators where creativity can flourish is important.We need to reward people for doing things that are different. Traditionally, academia is very narrow, with people sometimes existing in silos; there isn't a very good system in place for encouraging people to be interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary. If we're going to talk about getting our students to be collaborative, we have to be able to do that at our level, too, and show how that works. We need to create an administrative structure that makes it easy for people to do that. We need to set good examples."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/how-does-helping-others-help-us", "content": "The question \"How does helping others help us?\" caused me to reflect on my experiences serving others from the time I was in grade school through my current positions at Illinois Institute of Technology.The act of self-giving was a central part of my Catholic education from so many years ago. Faith and love were the cornerstones of my most memorable service experience from those days, a \"reversed missionary\" trip to Cuernavaca, Mexico. My group's accommodations had running water, a cafeteria, and flush toilets; the people we came to serve did not. I realized that the true objective of the experience was to meet people who had very few material possessions but had a large love of God and community, and great faith. Their homes were the size of a large bathroom in the United States and didn't have mattresses or tile floors, yet the families who lived in them were not downtrodden or bitter. This trip not only helped me to grow as a person, but it also inspired my work at IIT with the Alternative Spring Break (ASB) student organization and the Division of Student Affairs.New to the dean of students position in 2010, I was approached by former ASB participants who had concerns regarding their experiences. Among them was that the event highly depended upon IIT staff for trip planning; consequently, ASB students had limited motivation to raise money and sometimes even attend the trip. I reached into my past for inspiration and with the students made three improvements: creating a constitution and an executive board; moving the ASB selection process to the fall; and establishing rules and expectations that set a tone of service, not of privilege.As a leader of the Division of Student Affairs, I also wanted to promote teamwork as well as model the lifestyle of service we encourage for our students, and sought feedback from my staff on creating a service opportunity for division members. For our first service day last December at Chicago's RTW Veteran Center, 20 professional staff members cleaned toilets, scrubbed ovens, organized and sanitized a food pantry, washed dishes, and talked with center visitors for nearly four hours. The event was so successful that this May we served at multiple sites, including Benton House, the St. James Food Pantry, and Eden Place Nature Center.Accustomed as I am to not only working with students but also being inspired by them, I asked my two sons\u2014Ben, 7, and Conor, 9\u2014for their take on helping others and was amazed by their insight. My younger son said that helping people makes him happy, which put a smile on my face. Conor, however, basically told me that he helps people because he cares for them, not because doing so helps him. He focused on the person exclusively.While my experiences and observations over the years have done much to help me realize how the qualities of compassion, love, and sacrifice are important pieces of why service is so meaningful, for me, the best answer is always the simplest\u2014and just so happened to come out of the mouths of babes. Helping others helps me because as a human being I care and want to be a part of that process. And also, because it makes me happy."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2014/what-can-we-learn-failure", "content": "If we ask a basketball player to imagine taking the final shot of a game, that player will almost certainly imagine the ball going through the hoop to win the game. Similarly, if you close your eyes and imagine yourself completing an important school or work assignment, you will likely envision yourself being successful, maybe even wildly successful. Failure is not something we generally desire in our daily pursuits. That doesn't mean, however, that failure cannot provide positive outcomes.Indeed, there are rather famous examples of individuals who have achieved tremendous success after having failed spectacularly. Stephen King went through 30 rejections before his first novel,, was accepted for publication. Steven Spielberg was rejected from the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts more than once. Thomas Edison tried somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000 times before finally creating the light bulb. We could fill the pages ofwith similar examples from individuals across such diverse walks of life as business (Bill Gates), sports (Michael Jordan), and politics (Winston Churchill).Whenever we perform an activity, whether for work or for play, we routinely receive feedback, positive or negative, from our environment and adjust our behavior accordingly. We can all recall those times in our own lives when we were the recipients of positive feedback in the form of praise, adulation, or congratulations. Perhaps it was related to landing a big account, scoring the winning touchdown, or solving a particularly challenging problem. We may reflect on those times as.We can also likely recall times when we were the recipients of negative feedback such as scolding, receiving a poor grade, or perhaps even getting fired. Although theseexperiences may not elicit a smile, they are nonetheless absolutely critical if we want to learn about our capabilities, understand our strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately improve our performance.Despite the self-learning that can occur, failing is not a pleasurable experience. In the moment, we likely experience feelings of inadequacy, incompetence, anxiety, or any number of other unpleasant states. What is important about a failure experience is not the particular event, but rather, how the event is perceived and interpreted. If we refuse to see failing as a learning opportunity, we consign ourselves to allowing the failure to define usOne of the most important\u2014and repetitive\u2014failure experiences in my professional life is the rejection of papers submitted to academic journals. It is quite common to spend months, if not years, working on a research project, developing a manuscript, and submitting it to a top journal, only to have it rejected for publication. I learned very early in my graduate training that such rejection (failure) is to be expected and that my reaction should be to learn from the reviewer's criticisms, then revise the paper and resubmit it. Ultimate success can only be attained by incorporating the negative feedback and learning from past experiences.We have all failed and will continue to fail. Instead of focusing on the sting that might be associated with these events, we would do well to maintain a focus on how the experience will make us stronger in the future.

Many argue that the return on investment of time and money to earn a degree must be offset by high career earnings and low student debt. Some insist that value cannot be measured solely in monetary terms but must factor in a person's capacity to be a global citizen and critical thinker. Still others believe that the ultimate payoff of a college education is in the networking that takes place on campus, in the personal relationships and the professional connections students can establish and upon which they draw throughout their lives and careers. In fact, all of these are valid criteria for return on investment.As someone who has spent his entire adult life in academia, I would argue that the chance for oneself to build and strengthen intellectual capital is a primary reason why a college education and the overall campus experience are of great value. A student's undergraduate or graduate years will likely be one of the few opportunities when learning and discovery come first.For many of us, our own college years may have been one of the last times we stayed up all night debating the future of modern architecture, arguing if leadership can be learned, or discussing how to stop global warming. Engineering students took a humanities course just because it sounded interesting and some of us went to a lacrosse game even though we knew nothing about the sport.Education is more than a collection of courses. Its full value lies not just in what students learn in the classroom but also what students choose to do in the time they are on campus. If they opt to only go to class and take exams, then the return on their investment will be disappointing.If our students use this time to think big thoughts, see where their imaginations take them, try something new, seek out challenges, become inspired, argue, wonder, discuss, and ponder, then the value of their college degree will be exactly what it should be\u2014priceless.John L.

Or the surgeon who inquired about the legal rights of a frozen severed head that he wanted to attach to a suddenly available body.\"At one point I had a temporary secretary who threw out half of my messages because she thought they were pranks,\" says Andrews, Distinguished Professor of Law and director of IIT's Institute for Science, Law, and Technology (ISLAT).For Andrews, who was drawn to law by a desire to draft more pro-consumer policies, her bioethics mission seemed almost predestined. She passed the bar exam on the day the first test-tube baby was born. A paper she wrote in law school garnered her an invitation to speak at the first world conference on in vitro fertilization. That speech led to a flood of inquiries from doctors eager to understand the legal and moral implications of their work.Shortly after law school, she was asked to testify in Congress on issues related to surrogate motherhood and other reproductive technologies.\"At that point I was asked a lot of questions about what the law felt about this or that,\" she says. \"In many cases the law hadn't yet caught up, and so I had to start answering based upon ethical principles.\"When Dolly the sheep was cloned, the White House requested Andrews's advice on whether cloning of humans could legally be prohibited. She chaired the federal advisory commission that explored the ethical, legal, and social impacts of the Human Genome Project. Andrews also helped lead the successful charge against Myriad Genetics, a company that drove up patient costs and hindered medical research when it patented two genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers.A talk she gave on gene patent issues inspired author Michael Crichton to draft, a novel based on the topic. Andrews's own novels, a mystery series featuring fictional geneticist Alexandra Blake, have encouraged reading groups to discuss the legal and ethical issues raised in her books.\"I had a certain frustration with getting legal policy changed at the legislative level, and I wanted to spur public debate for things like genetic discrimination,\" she says. \"I knew I could reach more people by smuggling these ideas into traditional mystery novels.\"Recently Andrews began a new book with a different protagonist and a setting closer to home: a woman biotech researcher who lives in Chicago.She also launched a new initiative to protect the privacy of online health information. In a recent study of more than 200 medical apps, ISLAT researchers found that many leaked private data such as an individual's daily glucose levels to data aggregators and marketers. Even someone's online health topic searches and medical organizations \"liked\" on Facebook can be accessed by prospective employers or insurance providers, she says.\"We fought and eventually got a federal law passed that says employers and insurers can't discriminate against you if you're healthy yet have a genetic predisposition for a disease,\" she says. \"We now need something that will protect people who search for and post health-care information online.\"Named one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America by thefor her pioneering work in health law, Andrews has no intention of leaving the fight.

Known as the Frank-Starling Law of the Heart, it is as accepted as gravity and, like gravity, is still not fully understood. Using X-ray diffraction techniques, Thomas Irving from Illinois Tech's College of Science and Pieter de Tombe from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine discovered that the protein titin may play a critical role in the nano-science behind Frank-Starling. Blood enters the heart during its diastolic phase, when cardiac muscle is relaxed and lengthened. As the heart pumps and enters into its systolic phase, the muscle forcefully contracts through the interaction of myosin and actin protein filaments. Titin serves as a kind of elastic band that stores energy when cardiac muscle is stretched and releases energy when the muscle contracts and shortens. Irving and de Tombe learned that the action of titin pulling on the myosin filaments causes changes that ultimately result in increased strength of muscle contraction when muscle is stretched when the heart fills in the diastolic phase.Cleversafe founder and Illinois Institute of Technology Trustee Chris Gladwin delivered the 2016 Commencement keynote address, during which he asked the Class of 2016 to pose for a photo [above].

My enthusiasm and expectations for IIT have continually risen because of the achievements, values, and attitudes of our faculty, staff, and students. The support of our Board of Trustees has also provided a huge boost to our morale and aspirations. So the excitement of being president of IIT is even greater than a year ago. One cannot ask for more than that.Celebration of progress over the past year is a good tonic for aiming higher the next year, so I will offer some examples of how IIT has advanced. Two outstanding new leaders have been brought to campus, Alan Cramb as provost and senior vice president, and Russell Betts as dean of the College of Science and Letters. Our spring Commencement was held outdoors on campus for the first time in decades; college-level receptions, a great turnout by students and families, and wonderful weather made it a memorable occasion. Enrollment at both the undergraduate and graduate levels has improved faster than expected, and another strong class has been recruited for this year. We reconnected with many alumni chapters around the country and brought many alumni back to campus for a variety of celebrations. Eleven new members of diverse backgrounds were added to our Board of Trustees; of these, seven are alumni. Twenty new faculty of exceptional promise were hired. Our varsity athletes excelled on the field and in the classroom. Fifteen classrooms were renovated, and now 78 percent of our classrooms are in excellent condition. The non-stop efforts of our facilities staff improved our campus appearance. And new records were set in the annual pumpkin launch!So what lies ahead this year? Well, the budget is a challenge, especially while we maintain our commitment to improve the university, but we will manage this. The strategic plan, based on the idea of \"many voices, one vision,\" will be completed and action steps will be identified. Our facilities will be improved, and our national and international visibility will be increased. The president and other university leaders will seek input through more open communication with the campus community and alumni. Our relations with the Chicago community, though already good, will be made even better. All of us will reinforce our dedication to excellence, going beyond merely what is expected. And, of course, fundraising will increase to fuel our advances. These are collective efforts requiring the dedication of us all. We need to remember the words of Will Rogers: \"Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there.\"I assure you that IIT will not be sitting on the track.John L.

The national averages are also reflected at IIT, with 11 percent of IIT's bachelor's degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities last academic year.Even fewer underrepresented minorities obtain degrees in engineering and technology fields. ASEE's most recent figures, from 2006, indicate that African Americans received only 5 percent of the bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering that year. Just 6 percent of engineering bachelor's degrees were awarded to Hispanics. Last year 12 percent of IIT's engineering degrees were awarded to underrepresented minorities.Inequalities exist among faculty and women as well. Underrepresented minorities currently make up only 5 percent of all engineering faculty in the United States. A quarter of the black engineering professors teach at just a handful of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. While women comprise the majority\u201456 percent\u2014of all university undergraduates, only 19.3 percent received engineering bachelor's degrees in 2006, marking a steady eight-year decline. At IIT, one-fourth of our bachelor's degrees last year were awarded to women, who this year make up nearly a third of total undergraduate enrollment and 20 percent of engineering undergraduates.By 2020, underrepresented minorities are expected to rise to nearly 35 percent of the population\u2014Hispanics will comprise 18 percent, African Americans 14 percent, and the growing population of Native-American and other non-Asian races is projected to be 3.5 percent. By 2050, the combined African-American, Hispanic, and NativeAmerican/other population will compose nearly 45 percent of our country. Clearly, today's underrepresented minorities stand to become tomorrow's underrepresented majority.As former vice chair of the ASEE Engineering Deans' Council Executive Board, I know how great a challenge improving science and engineering education in this country, particularly for underrepresented minorities, can be. However, we cannot allow this challenge to become a missed opportunity for our young people or our country.The National Academies' Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century provides a variety of recommendations to improve engineering and science education: increasing interest in these disciplines among K\u201312 students, training more qualified teachers, improving masters in science education programs, and investing in math and science specialty schools, among other suggestions. In addressing minorities in these fields, the Building Engineering and Science Talent committee further notes the need for financial support for individuals, increased work experience, improved social networks, and campus-wide efforts to increase inclusiveness.IIT is on the right track. From our new Collens Scholarship Program to our ongoing and strengthening ties with Chicago Public Schools and Bronzeville to improved recruitment and retention efforts, the university is taking important steps toward change. These and other initiatives are included in this issue's feature on African Americans at IIT. However, much more effort is needed if IIT is to be a leader in educating today's minorities for tomorrow's opportunities in innovative technologies.The acceptance of all people regardless of race or ethnicity is an important part of IIT's past and present. We are a top research university with strengths in engineering, science, and professional studies. Through our location within Chicago, we are committed to educating increasingly more of today's minority population for future leadership in these fields and in society.John L.

We are also establishing task forces on redefining and reengineering our Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) program for undergraduates, defining university-wide themes for research and distinctive education, improving administrative services for students, and enhancing student participation in our sports programs. You will hear more about these activities in the fall.One major campus-wide initiative we are pursuing actively is the IIT Perfect Power System, the cover story of this issue. To excel in this area will require a significant university investment even in this tough time. The concept of Perfect Power is relatively simple, but achieving a real system is a complex research and development project that requires the collaboration of many faculty, students, and staff across the university, and partnerships with outside organizations. While the current financial situation favors caution, the opportunity cost of not pursuing this initiative in a serious way could threaten our momentum toward leadership in this area.It has been said that change is inevitable, but improvement is optional.

There is a \"good\" choice of university for every student wishing to advance her or his education; the challenge is finding the right fit. It is in the best interest of each private university to build on its unique characteristics and publicize its distinctive offerings. We want to find those students whose interests align with the distinctiveness of our university\u2014creating a synergistic relationship for the benefit of the university and the student.The name of IIT gives it away, but our vision statement emphasizes our niche: \"\u2026focus on professional and technology-oriented education\u2026.\" We are not the best choice for all students, but we are a great choice for those students who wish to be educated in these areas. IIT belongs to the Association of Independent Technological Universities (AITU), a group of 22 schools running the gamut from MIT and Caltech to Rose-Hulman and Harvey Mudd, and connected by an emphasis on a technology-relevant curriculum. Such universities have been criticized for being \"too narrow\" and not providing a \"well-rounded\" education, opinions never supported by fact. The pendulum is shifting now, and schools like IIT are gaining more positive attention because of the need to educate more technology-savvy young adults. Studies such as Rising Above the Gathering Storm (National Academy of Sciences, 2005) and opinion pieces such as Thomas Friedman's editorial in The New York Times (January 11, 2009) emphasize the need for the U.S. to produce more graduates in technology fields. The need to increase IIT graduates of all our areas of study, not just engineering, is clear.The input to our strategic planning from students, faculty, staff, and members of our Board of Trustees resonates on one particular chord: make the IIT educational experience distinctive even among other schools that also emphasize technology in education. While some areas of our current curriculum are distinctive, our goal is to create distinctiveness as a university. We believe our niche involves experience and education both outside the classroom as well as inside it\u2014in interdisciplinary team projects, entrepreneurship activities, leadership training, communication skills, international awareness, and service to the community. Note that I am not just referring to undergraduate education; innovation in graduate education is also needed. IIT has long been recognized as very strong in its depth of education. Now we must augment this depth with training in experiential learning\u2014the out-of-classroom experiences. By doing so, we will be an innovator in education.IIT has been a major innovator with its Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) program courses, which were initiated in 1995. As far as I can tell, we are one of the very few research universities to adopt interdisciplinary project courses across the university as a requirement for all undergraduates. The challenge now, as emphasized by input to our strategic planning process, is to further develop the IPRO education experience, to improve it, and to expand its reach to connect our undergraduate students with our wonderful professional programs. We have a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on our strengths in technology and the professions to do something very special in education.The university's strategic plan will be unveiled in May 2009. An important part of that plan is to expand IIT's distinctive education. We welcome your insight and suggestions.John L.

Change takes us out of our comfort zone and challenges us to look at what we are doing in different ways, with the possibility that we should be doing something else staring us in the face. Very few people enjoy this exercise, but it is a critical precursor to advancement. I find students much more amenable to the idea of change; in fact, they often demand such a culture. One of the most enjoyable facets of teaching is addressing the students' constant insistence on change\u2014in what we teach and how we teach it. I am very pleased to report that our faculty members are also embracing the concept with very good results.Some indicators that change at IIT is indeed occurring include:What's ahead?

The heart of a strategic plan is its vision statement. Too often such statements are generic. A vision statement should do two things: identify the institution and define its priorities. We have written a new vision statement for IIT that meets these two criteria [see p. 15].From February 2008 until May 2009, we engaged the entire IIT community in developing the university's vision, priorities, and goals, and the outcome is a new strategic plan for IIT, Many Voices, One Vision. We worked hard to answer the questions \"what do we want to be?\" and \"how do we get there?\"Now we embark on the next important stage: implementation. Task forces are being set up to define and execute the initiatives required by the vision, for example, an Innovation Sandbox, an International Academy, and elements of a distinctive IIT education. This stage is not easy, but I believe that setting a high target, as described by our vision statement, was even more difficult. Now we know what we are aiming to do.Our strategic plan is a living document and will be adjusted annually to reflect changes in circumstances\u2014internal and external to the university. Strategies will be modified to cope with changing conditions and to exploit new opportunities, but the vision remains constant. It is our target and will not move until it is achieved.An important facet of strategic planning is its level of expectations. There is great value in setting high expectations. My four decades of faculty service have convinced me that when you expect more, you get more. Expectations of oneself and others represent a critical component to improvement. We are aiming high, and we intend to get there.It's all about our vision. It is aggressive and optimistic. To reach our goals, we need the help of the entire IIT community\u2014alumni and friends, faculty, staff, students, the Board of Trustees, and our local community.

The fact is, learning is the responsibility of both students and faculty, and it doesn't occur just in the classroom.There has been much progress in college-level teaching since I started. No university teacher disputes the importance of gaining disciplinary knowledge; a student should graduate knowing something. However, now there is an appreciation that students learn in different ways, not just one way, and that teachers must try to reach their students using multiple approaches. There is a greater appreciation that out-of-classroom activities are very important to supplement in-class learning. Communication skills, the ability to work in teams composed of persons with different educational and social backgrounds, and embracing change as an opportunity instead of a threat\u2014these attributes are also part of learning at the college level. Students tend to have difficulty in courses that involve open-ended problems where there is not a single correct answer or perfect solution; of course, their careers will be determined by how well they address such problems.One of IIT's priorities is to provide a distinctive education. To achieve this, we must develop an educational environment that prepares students for the first day as well as 20 years after graduation. Disciplinary, in-classroom teaching addresses the former, while open-ended project courses and out-of-class experiences help address the latter. The faculty of IIT is doing much to advance student learning in environments that go beyond the traditional lecture, taking advantage of rapid changes in technology. Below I mention two initiatives that are subjects of articles in this magazine.The Idea Shop, the topic of our cover story, is a new facility on Main Campus where students will experience openended learning outside the classroom. Housed in IIT's University Technology Park, the Idea Shop is now home to our Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program. Through both IPRO courses and entrepreneurial endeavors, students will use the Idea Shop to research and test their projects, aided by rapid-prototyping equipment and an open floor plan that facilitates teamwork and stimulates creativity. The Idea Shop will provide our students the freedom to learn from their mistakes as they work to develop better solutions to problems.Secondly, IIT is incorporating iPads into the educational experience. All incoming, first-year undergraduates were provided their own iPad at the beginning of this academic year. While PowerPoint has become ubiquitous in educational settings, its main use has been as an on-screen chalkboard. iPads will take learning even further. These devices are being integrated into coursework, allowing instructors to increase interactivity through means such as instant quizzing. iPads break down the walls, both literal and figurative, that laptop use in the classroom often presents. Additionally, because all students and the instructor are using the same iPad software, notes and problem examples can be shared seamlessly.Through new technologies and a fresh approach to pedagogy, IIT is providing students a more varied and engaging educational experience that will prepare them for long-term career success.\"Involve me and I understand.\" This is the basis of the distinctive IIT education.John L.

'69) describes one element of a pivotal event that ignited the country's gay rights movement and his own passionate cause for equality for gay veterans.\"He\" was Allen R. Schindler Jr., a 22-year-old sailor from Chicago Heights, Ill., who was stomped and pummeled to death on October 27, 1992, in Sasebo, Japan, while on shore leave from his duty aboard the USS Belleau Wood. According to an article in the New York Times Magazine, a pathologist who examined Shindler's body said it was the most severe trauma he had ever witnessed.Shipmate Airman Apprentice Terry Helvey admitted during questioning that he had a hatred of homosexuals and was sentenced to life in a military prison for Schindler's murder. Miriam Ben-Shalom, who founded the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Veterans of America (now American Veterans for Equal Rights [AVER]) in 1990 and helped Schindler's mother retain an attorney in the case, reached out to James Darby to open a GLBVA Chicago Chapter. Darby had supported Ben-Shalom's GLBVA efforts and told her she had done the right thing in her own fight against discrimination in the military. She took her case to be allowed to serve in the United States Army, even as a lesbian, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"Schindler's murder was a bombshell for the gay veterans movement and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, both happening at the same time,\" says Darby, who retired in 1992 after a 30-year Chicago Public Schools career. The civil rights of gays and lesbians, most notably their open service in the military, was a political issue during the candidacy of President Bill Clinton, who in 1993 implemented the Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT) policy, which ended last September. \"Those moments in history were when everything coalesced together and went off like a rocket,\" he says.William Lopez (LAW '11)\u2014a fast-talking, energetic, magna cum laude graduate\u2014joining Darby and his partner of 48 years, Patrick Bova, for the first time, recalls the \"fire was lit\" on his own gay rights activism when he heard a presentation at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law on DADT by Lambda Legal, the nation's oldest and largest legal organization working for the civil rights of gays, lesbians, and people with HIV/AIDS.Lopez says the presentation made him realize how much discrimination was occurring in the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) community, and he ran after the presenter, asking how he could get involved. Lopez was awarded a summer internship with Lambda Legal.\"Every day Lambda Legal was doing something to impact legal change in the community,\" says Lopez. \"Being part of all that for three months showed me that it was exactly what I want to do.\"Lopez was later named president of Chicago-Kent's Lambdas and organized the college's first LGBT Civil Rights Conference. He has since been hired as the first openly gay associate at Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP.Openly gay since the age of 16, Lopez had supportive friends, and parents who became more supportive as time went on. As a University of Miami undergraduate, he began to see that homosexuality was another diversity \"checkmark\" that he could bring to the table, whether applying for schools or jobs. He listened in astonishment as Darby recalled the first time he was invited to a Chicago gay bar in the 1950s.\"We had two drinks and suddenly, all of the lights went on and police ran in the front door; it was a raid. I ran out the back door with everybody else right up a ramp leading into a paddy wagon,\" says Darby. \"I was thrown into a cell with a guy from the Air Force. The judge said, 'What is this country coming to? You're in the Navy and you're in the Air Force, and both in a place like that!\"Darby had kept his homosexuality a secret during his four years as a United States Navy communications technician and Russian translator and felt fortunate that he was able to receive all of his post-military benefits, such as the G.I. Bill. Recipient of a National Defense Service Medal and the Naval Occupation Service Medal, he thought it unfair that so many veterans\u2014even those who had served for 20 years\u2014had lost their benefits because it was revealed that they were gay.Since founding the Chicago GLBVA, Darby has held offices with the organization at both the local and national levels, including president. He has lobbied in Washington, D.C., for LGBTQ rights and continues to serve as editor of AVER's The Forward Observer newsletter. Additionally, he has served as secretary of the Mayor's Advisory Council on Veterans Affairs since 1995. Because of Darby, LGBTQ veterans are saluted each year at Daley Plaza, feted at a Veterans Day dinner, and walk in Chicago's Memorial Day Parade. Bova notes, however, that civil rights issues related to gays in the military remain.\"One of the chief roadblocks is the Defense of Marriage Act, where benefits guaranteed to married couples recognized by DOMA are not guaranteed in civil unions,\" he says. \"We are in a civil union in Illinois and that means we have state rights in Illinois.

Weir has been busy sorting items from 19 collection sites for this year's project, which runs through July 22.Weir's first SouthTown 9.12 Project drive over spring/summer 2011 brought in close to $15,000 in supplies-enough to prepare 230 individual-sized boxes-donated largely from Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood, where Weir lives and grew up, and the other near South Side communities. The abundance reflected the name of the project-9.12-for the spirit of the united front Americans presented on the day after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\"I couldn't believe the outpouring; it was nothing I expected,\" admits Weir, noting that veterans were especially generous, purchasing goods from discounted retail shops to stretch their meager dollars and maximize their donations.Weir's only connection to the military is her father, a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Korean Conflict, and her daughter Joanna, a third-year IIT College of Psychology student, who had expressed an interest in either joining the military or counseling veterans after graduation. After attending the Derby party, Weir took her idea to the community with a local newspaper appeal. One by one, citizens and groups responded, providing suggestions for drop-off sites and even payment for shipping costs.A unique aspect of the SouthTown 9.12 Project is in its simplicity: family and friends with loved ones in the military share their names and addresses with Weir, who then surprises the recipient with a special delivery box of treats. If a post-drive surplus of items exists, the remaining portion is sent to local armories and other organizations working to support the military.\"The project is important to me because I love helping people,\" says Joanna Weir, who assists her mother with the SouthTown 9.12 Project and volunteers for the summer at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. \"The soldiers serving in Afghanistan and around the world need these supplies to stay upbeat, entertained, and healthy. It's important that they know we appreciate the sacrifices they make every day so we can remain free. I'm happy that I can give them what they need and put a smile on their faces.\"Echoing her sentiments, serviceman Jeremy Domagalski at Camp Vance in Bagram, Afghanistan, sent an email to the SouthTown 9.12 Project noting that he distributed the contents of his box to some local children as well as his comrades and expressing his deep gratitude for the gift's serendipitous arrival.\"I wish I could keep going on about how much this has meant to everyone, but we're going to a memorial in 15 minutes for all of the soldiers who fell in the mass attack last night that left one of our bases burned to the ground,\" he said. \"So this package couldn't have come at a better time.

They'll remember my name-and my magic.\"That's no hocus-pocus. Liu is a professional close-up magician who often uses his showmanship to help the audience remember another topic about which he is most passionate: protecting the environment.Thirteen years ago, in his hometown of He Fei, Liu began to teach himself tricks by watching magicians perform on China Central Television. With additional skills gleaned from books he read on close-up magic, Liu joined the student magic club at East China Jiaotong University and soon became the group's chair, recruiting new magician apprentices, coordinating public performances, and garnering local media attention. An environmental engineering major, Liu thought his magic acts could double for a novel educational opportunity for viewers.\"One time my magic team went into the college community and talked to the residents about the importance of separating their garbage,\" recalls Liu. \"I changed some leaves from yellow to green, like from winter to spring, and told them if they could protect the environment, they could help to change the world.\"Liu wished to broaden his knowledge and came to the United States in December 2011.

Actually, Gandhi believes he has. For him it is the faith-based philosophy that he was born into in Mumbai, India, and which inspires him daily.\"We are Jains,\" he says about the ancient religion-Jainism-he and his family practice. \"Two of the aspects we as a group follow are making donations and doing community service.\"Jains adhere to nonviolence and avoid harming all life forms-human, animal, plant, and even those too small to be seen by the naked eye. Gandhi recalls that from an early age he, his twin brother, and his parents would regularly visit cowsheds and animal welfare centers in Mumbai simply to spend time with the animals housed there.In grade 11, he assumed his first service leadership role as president of the Red Ribbon Club, a student initiative to help spread HIV/AIDS awareness in Mumbai.\"We went to public beaches to hand out condoms, performed educational street plays, and visited homes with HIV-infected children. That's when I really realized how doing service could contribute to the growth of an individual,\" he says.After Gandhi came to the United States in August 2010 to attend IIT, he discovered the many service-learning opportunities both on campus and in the surrounding communities. In spring 2011, Gandhi was selected to become a community ambassador of the One Chicago, One Nation (OCON) project. The event aimed to improve understanding among the various faiths and cultures within the Chicago metropolitan area as well as to stimulate community action. The OCON program was featured in a New York Times article with comments from Gandhi.Along with Shimer College student Mohini Lal, Gandhi coordinated a project benefiting the Bridgeport neighborhood's Benton House community center as part of IIT's third annual Big Event day of community service. The pair received a $2,000 grant from OCON and enlisted a student crew to build a 10-foot garden bed, plant vegetable seeds, repaint program spaces, create murals, run a food drive, and collect donations for youth programs.\"I was impressed by Utsav's immense power and leadership to rally 100 students to do service on a Saturday morning and afternoon,\" says Kristina Tendilla, Benton House community outreach and civic engagement director. \"I was also so impressed by his openness to sculpt service projects to the needs of Benton House and our community.\"This spring, Gandhi once again participated in The Big Event and also served as the fundraising chair for the student organization Alternative Spring Break (ASB), helping the team defray the cost of traveling to Valdosta, Ga., to work with Habitat for Humanity. Much as Gandhi-who hopes for a career at the United Nations-values his formative years in service, he says that a more recent event created an indelible memory.\"At last year's ASB, one of my primary jobs was attaching Tyvek waterproofing paper to houses. The lady who was going to be living in one of the houses was working alongside me. At the end of our project, she told me that once she moved in, whenever it rained, she would think of us students and all of the hard work we did,\" says Gandhi. \"That really impacted me.\"Jainism:New York Times article on OCON:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2012/pump-volume", "content": "\"Anybody want to be a guinea pig?\"Immediately, 25 hands shoot up.They belong to students at Hanson Park Elementary, a public elementary and middle school on Chicago's West Side. School has finished for the day, but these students are taking part in scienceFIST, an after-school program spearheaded by Marc Hans (MSED '10), a teacher at Hanson Park.Hans started scienceFIST for the same reason he became a teacher in the first place: because he hated school as a kid. That was in suburban Morton Grove, Ill., where he thought the education system wasn't geared towards kids like him, who had trouble sitting still.\"I figured there were kids like me who needed somebody who understood them,\" he says.There's not much sitting still in scienceFIST. Today, Hans has brought in a guest speaker, Simon Fung, a 3M product developer who led the technical team that developed a revolutionary new medical tape that hit the market in 2011. Fung flew in from Minnesota to speak to these students as part of a partnership between scienceFIST and the Edison Awards, and he has all 25 of them compare his blue medical tape to traditional white plastic tape. The blue tape is just as sticky as the white tape, but it doesn't hurt when they peel it off their skin.The students are impressed, but Hans quickly shifts their focus from the product to the process.\"The people who developed this product are just like you,\" he tells his students. \"They are people who want to solve problems, who are good at science, technology, and math.\"Hans won a Golden Apple Award in 2011, an award given annually to 10 standout teachers in the Chicago area. Now he's trying to expand scienceFIST beyond Hanson Park; the program is operating in 10 schools this year, and he's hired a part-time program manager, Kate McGroarty, to coordinate the other sites.McGroarty's job is to figure out how much of Hans's methods can be transferred to other schools and how much is uniquely his. She believes scienceFIST can expand successfully, but also acknowledges that Hans's classroom is special.Hans \"has more energy than any person I've ever met, kids included, when he gets a vision in his head of something he wants to happen,\" she says.As Fung concludes his presentation, Hans gathers the students together in the center of the room and asks Fung for a parting word of wisdom. Fung thinks for a second, then answers, \"People used to say, 'You are such a nerd.' Well, I love what I do, and I don't care what you call me.\"None of the kids laughs. In fact, they're fired up\u2014none more so than Hans, who says, \"That deserves a science fist!\" All 25 students make a fist and thrust their hands toward the center of the circle. They yell \"SCIENCE FIST!\" in unison.Soon, Hans, Fung, and all the kids are heading down Fullerton Avenue to the Taco & Burrito House, a restaurant that's been providing discounts to Hans's groups for years. When the kids start munching on chips and salsa, they're still talking about Fung's blue tape\u2014and about science.\"There are a lot of activities and experiments, and fun little twists to scienceFIST,\" says Anthony, a seventh grader. \"It used to be, out of all the subjects, I didn't love science. Now it's in my top two or three.\"Oscar, his classmate, agrees. \"A lot of kids say they hate science, but you know, it's not the subject, it's how you learn it. ScienceFIST is pretty cool.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2008/model-railroad-club-iit", "content": "Above the fifth floor of Main Building, in an area inaccessible by elevator and reachable only via a short stairway largely out of view, is a firehouse, a gas station, a shopping district, even a freight warehouse and a cold storage facility\u2014all of it part of 3,000 feet of miniature train track crossing over a trestle, coursing through a tunnel, cruising down a straight-away. Friday evenings, the sounds of steam being emitted from an engine, two whistle blasts, then a locomotive with cars and caboose in tow fill the room, the train chugging down the tracks.The club was started by students in 1948, a time when passenger and freight trains were a primary means of transport, and the city as train hub was host to the Chicago Railroad Fair. One student asked his father, the superintendent of buildings and grounds, to help locate space on campus for ITMR. The \"attic\" of Main Building was found to be largely unused and fit the club's needs. Since several early members were civil engineering majors who spent summers practicing surveying at IIT's Camp Armour in Boulder Junction, Wis., the first layout was given the name Camp Armour and Boulder Junction Railroad. Over the nearly 60 years that the club has been in existence, the layout has changed several times. In 1974, the main route was redesigned to run from Chicago to Peoria, a layout that remains to this day. For sentimental reasons, the name of the railway line has remained and among its members is affectionately known as \".\"Train enthusiast John Massura (CHEM '72) has been driving from his home near Chicago's Midway Airport to Main Campus most Friday evenings for 37 years, give or take time off for illness, the occasional Boy Scout trip, or a railroad show. \"We operate the first three weeks of the even months,\" explains Massura, one of ITMR's 37 dues-paying members\u2014men and women of all ages and life statuses, some with IIT connections and others without, all bound together by their love of trains. \"The other weeks we continue constructing the railroad because it's not done. And it will probably never be, because they say if your railroad is done, then you have to tear it down and start over.\"\"We talk about all kinds of things, mostly railroading, sometimes not. It's the camaraderie.\"In 1950, however, club members had to remake the layout because the peak above the attic was destroyed by fire and the train setup was irreparably damaged by water. Today's layout, which fills every alcove of the attic, comprises three lines: a main line, running from Chicago to Peoria; a foreign, or short line, running from Joliet to Streator; and a narrow gauge line, running from Streator to Galena. All lines trace fictitious routes that conform to practices and standards established by theto ensure a level of consistency in layouts throughout the country, and to provide for interchange of cars and locomotives.The club's standard gauge lines, for example, are scaled to the proportion of .1378 inches to every one foot of real rail measurement, known as HO Scale. According to Massura, each basswood tie is hand-laid, with every other tie hammered into place with Lilliputian-sized metal spikes. This degree of detail is not only achievable but is a source of pride for club members who are eager to augment a hobby they intensely enjoy.\"Almost everything I learned about model railroading\u2014when you get down to this kind of ability\u2014I learned from people here,\" says Massura, crediting his ITMR \"crew\" as being the prototype for his model railroad learning experience.While he used his knowledge of circuitry and wiring obtained as a telecommunications employee to configure much of the inner workings of the layout's DC-powered system, Massura notes that club newcomers need not feel intimidated by their lack of certain capabilities. \"This is one hobby where you need quite a few skills\u2014carpentry, electrical, artistry, machinery, and probably a half dozen more,\" he says. \"But someone will help you where you're unsure, so you will learn from them.\" Members are next planning work on track detection, a sophisticated electronic technique whereby signals are cued to turn from red to green through a \"gentle short\" applied to the rails by means of the caboose, a car that is a required feature of any train that is run at the club.The train that eventually brought Massura to the attic of Main Building was the one that circled his family's Christmas tree in the home where he grew up, one block from where he now lives. After three years of displaying the set only during the holiday season, Massura's father, John, put the train onto a 4x8 plywood sheet, and he and his son began adding switches and assorted cars, eventually moving the setup from under the tree to the dining room and finally to the basement where the one plywood sheet grew to four sheets. After his father passed away, Massura inherited his entire train collection, including the Lionel Christmas cars. Now he is passing on his joy of trains to members of Generation Z. Massura plans to purchase Lionels for his 4-year-old grandsons, and he counsels Boy Scouts who are earning a merit badge in railroading. He is also building a model railroad in the basement of his home, a fantasy narrow gauge route through southwestern Colorado. His ITMR colleagues have helped him add to it over the years; Massura expects it to be 25x40 when complete\u2014that is, if it is ever completed.A soft-spoken man who enjoys wearing railway-inspired T-shirts purchased at train conventions, Massura retired from AT&T in April 2007. He is former treasurer of the Chicago chapter of Mensa and remains an active member. It is the train life, however, that Massura loves, and for him and a cadre of ITMR friends, it has become a true labor of love.Each Tuesday evening for the past 16 months, Massura and a half-dozen members who comprise a \"round robin\" railroading group have been meeting to complete the construction of a model setup begun by a man most of the group has never met. One member of Massura's group was approached by the widow of a member of the church to which he belonged, who asked him if he knew of any model railroad buffs who could complete the train layout her late husband started. Massura and his friends readily agreed. After all, this project is another opportunity to share in their passion and fellowship.\"We talk about all kinds of things, mostly railroading, sometimes not,\" says Massura. \"It's the camaraderie.\"The Illinois Tech Model Railroad Club meets every Friday from 7-11 p.m. in Main Building on Main Campus.

Visitors enter through a revolving door, check in at the reception desk, and go their respective ways, perhaps to the Department of Mathematics and Science Education or to the wing that houses Shimer College. But for those on their way to the(ITR) club, both the journey and its destination qualify for what might be described as a walk on the wild side.After navigating a series of left and right turns, one arrives at a single metal door, normally secured by a combination lock. Once over the threshold, there is now a set of doors to enter. Painted bright blue and composed of steel two-inches thick, the doors feature a sign that warns of the presence of ionizing radiation. Christopher Jones (AE '07), biomedical engineering doctoral student and ITR president, refers to them as the \"blast doors.\" That name is appropriate for two reasons. For one, the room was the site of the first industrial nuclear reactor, which was decommissioned in the mid-1970s. The other reason is that it is ITR's workspace and sanctuary, where a tight-knit group of students have a good old time building robots, like a rock-and-roll robot that has garnered a best design award for two consecutive years in the AMD Jerry Sanders Creative Design Competition (JSDC).The robot\u2014named RMS Dick Roslund after one of the students\u2014really is a rock-and-roll 'bot.\"The coolest thing about this robot is its mobility,\" explains Jones. \"The robot can go in any direction, at any time. Most robots have to move forward or backward like a car, or otherwise change the orientation of their frame in order to go in a different direction. Our robot can immediately strafe in any translational direction without steering the frame; we have separate controls that allow the driver to rotate the robot.\"Mecanum wheels, essentially a conventional wheel with rollers attached to its circumference at 45-degree angles to the wheel, allow the robot to translate without steering. The ITR robot's human driver controls its movements using a PlayStation\u00ae2-style controller that is hooked up to a laptop computer that communicates with the 'bot via a wi-fi link.The robot is also the King of Cool because it rocks out, literally. ITR had the only robot at the annual design competition, held March 13\u201314 at the University of Illinois Urbana\u2013Champaign, that played music (fed from an MP3 player) and flashed blue lights, sometimes to a bass beat. This year's event featured a tic-tac-toe game in which the robots had to move weighted, air-filled balloons into boxes. At one point, another team's robot pushed ITR's off a platform, so during the next round the ITR 'bot played the English band Chumbawamba's hit, \"I Get Knocked Down,\" much to the enjoyment of referees and competitors alike.\"With four robots at a time, it gets pretty intense,\" says Jones. \"They held a demolition round at the end. That was fun to watch, but we kept our robot out of it!\"That's understandable, since JSDC judge and engineering idol Grant Imahara from the Discovery Channel's science series \"\" selected ITR as the winner of the \"Most Creative Design\" award and even autographed the 'bot's polycarbonate panel.Any wonder that Imahara was perhaps influenced by the Chicago White Sox cap that the ITR robot sported throughout the competition?Check out the Illinois Tech Robotics robot in action at the 2009 AMD Jerry Sanders Creative Design Competition at.Illinois Tech Robotics:AMD Jerry Sanders Creative Design Competition:\"MythBusters\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2008/iit-mens-soccer-move", "content": "Soccer on the South Side of Chicago? What's next, a construction-free Dan Ryan expressway? Believe it or not, both of these seeming oddities are a reality for IIT's student body this fall. And fortunately for the growing number of fans of the IIT men's soccer team, the best seats to be had aren't from traffic jams on the Dan Ryan, but rather a stone's throw away at beautifully manicured Stuart Field.Although IIT's men's soccer program is entering only its sixth season of existence this fall, Head Coach Lee Hitchen isn't settling for platitudes like \"growth\" or \"improvement\"\u2014he wants to win, and win immediately. \"When we first started it was, 'Okay, here comes the geek squad, let's put our second team on the field, get some goals, and get a win under our belt,'\"\u00a0he says with a laugh. \"In the past we were a guaranteed win, but now these teams get beat, and they don't like it.\"Winning has become something of a habit for IIT, which finished with a 9-5-4 record last season. In fact, were it not for a miracle last-minute header by Judson University striker Leonardo Silva, the Scarlet Hawks would have captured their first Chicagoland Collegiate Athletics Conference (CCAC) title and an automatic birth in theregionals. Instead, largely because of a cryptic NAIA rating system called \"longo points,\" the team was bounced from the regionals into a rematch with Olivet Nazarene in the CCAC tournament, which resulted in a season-ending 2-1 loss.If anyone is still dwelling on last season's disappointing finish, they're not letting on. \"When I first came in, the team was made up of a bunch of guys who just liked to play soccer,\" says redshirt Andrew John Lichaj (BA, 3rd year) of the team's evolution. \"Now the team is full of guys that have all played at a high level, and Coach Hitchen has done a great job of recruiting; every year we get better.\", head coach of conference rival St. Xavier University, calls the Scarlet Hawks' improvement \"impressive.\" He adds, \"They've become an upper-echelon team, the kind you have to fight for 90 minutes.\"\"We're bringing in players from all over the world\u2014the U.K., Ireland, Australia, Brazil\u2014which will increase the competition for places and force every player to work harder.\" \u2014Michael Tilatti (MMAE, 3rd year)This kind of respect and peer recognition isn't just flattering, it's crucial to any collegiate coach's recruiting efforts. As Hitchen explains, \"Until you build your reputation, you can't recruit top talent.\" So Hitchen, a Brit with a background as a professional player for the Blackburn Rovers of the English Premier League, adopted a unique recruiting strategy. He began using his network of former coaches and teammates as an international recruiting network, with the hopes that assembling a cast of seasoned international players would help him attract some of Chicago's plentiful youth talent.This brings with it entirely different challenges\u2014challenges that your average coach in the United States, accustomed to soccer as a sport of the largely affluent suburban set, isn't used to dealing with. \"The problem is that everywhere else in the world, nine times out of 10, these players are working-class kids who do not have the finances to support a $35,000 a year education, especially when in their home countries, school is largely free,\" he says. His approach is paying dividends: Hitchen's roster boasts 11 international student-athletes from locales as far-flung as England, Scotland, Brazil, Australia, Venezuela, and Spain as well as six returning players from the Chicago area.As Hitchen points out, recruiting is further complicated by two other major factors: IIT's sterling academic standards and the specialization of the university's scientific disciplines. \"I don't think people realize just how small the pool of candidates actually is,\" he says. \"I could walk into any game of senior high-school athletes and say, 'That kid's awesome, I want him.' If I were at any other university, I could probably get him. But I can't do that here. The first step is, okay, what are his grades? I don't even know his name yet, but I'm asking, 'What are his grades?' And then you have to hope that he wants to be an engineer, or a scientist, or an architect.\"\"We are competing not just against conference schools, but also schools like Northwestern, Drexel, and Carnegie Mellon,\" he says\u2014universities that IIT will likely never even face on the playing field.Additionally, the NAIA's relatively low admission requirements for athletes don't do IIT any favors. \"Academic standards for the NAIA are way below our standards,\" Hitchen says, and he's not kidding: NAIA student-athletes are not required to take the SAT or ACT exams as long as they graduate in the top half of their high-school class. This is a decided edge in favor of most of IIT's competitors.Despite the rigors of being student-athletes at a demanding university like IIT, Hitchen's recruits have more than held their own, maintaining a 3.2 GPA last season; in fact, no student in the team's five-year history has been disqualified from the program for academic reasons. Michael Tilatti (MMAE, 4th year) is perhaps the best example of the successful union between academics and athletics that Hitchen has achieved; the goalkeeper carries a 3.88 GPA while studying aerospace engineering. \"The key is good time management,\" Tilatti says. \"You need to be disciplined; there is not a lot of time to fool around. IIT is very difficult, but there is still time to finish your work if you manage your time right.\"Academics aside, it's hard not to admire the talent that Hitchen has assembled in such a short amount of time. Striker Graeme Port (HUM, 2nd year), a sophomore from Scotland, took the league by storm last season, scoring a remarkable 10 goals en route to being named both an NAIA All-American (the first such nomination in the history of IIT men's soccer) andFreshman of the Year. Additionally, midfielder Steven Booher (ARCH, 5th year), forward Pedro Lima (BA, 5th year), and defender Phillip Brierley (BA, 3rd year) earned All-Conference honors.This year's prospects look bright. \"This team is going to improve immensely this season,\" predicts goaltender Tilatti. \"We're bringing in players from all over the world\u2014the U.K., Ireland, Australia, Brazil\u2014which will increase the competition for places and force every player to work harder if they want to get on to the first team. This will only help the squad get better.\"Hitchen notes that the Scarlet Hawks' recent success has attracted the notice of the two premiere youth soccer organizations in the Chicago area, which should help to provide an additional influx of fresh talent into the program. However, \"It's not enough success for me,\" he says. \"I want more, and I really think we're on course to get there. We've raised the bar in the game. We're not there yet, but we're well on the way.\"I started playing soccer as soon as I could walk, just like everyone else back home [in Scotland]. I think I joined my first team when I was about 6. I played for various club teams when I was growing up and then progressed from there to play for several youth teams affiliated with professional clubs. When I heard about the opportunity to come to America, I jumped at the chance. It gives me the opportunity both to play soccer and continue my education, something that you can't really do back in the U.K.The transition was surprisingly easy for me. I guess being 21 helped a lot as I'd already been living away from my parents for a couple of years prior to coming to the States. Coach Hitchen set up everything for all the new players that came in, and the fact that I was living with two other British lads also helped a lot. The soccer team in general is a great bunch of lads.I had a couple of schools to choose from, but after I spoke with Coach Hitchen on the phone, there really was nowhere else that I wanted to go. The city of Chicago is a huge pull and having an English coach was also a big appeal for me. Coach Hitchen is a great coach and he really looks after all the lads both on and off the pitch. IIT is really lucky to have such a talented soccer team, and I just hope that this year we can finally win some titles to prove how good a side we actually have.If I were given the chance to continue playing soccer after college I would definitely take it. The MLS [] is improving all the time, and I would jump at the chance if given the opportunity to play in it. Playing in Europe would be great, but honestly I'd play almost anywhere if given the chance. Playing for Scotland might be a stretch too far though, as\u2014contrary to popular belief\u2014the team is actually quite good."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2008/studying-flow-life", "content": "On a typical summer day, colorful sailboats stream across Lake Michigan, their graceful bows neatly carving the water. For many enjoying the afternoon, the gusts and currents of air filling the sails, the curling eddies of water developing in the boats' wake, are incidental to the relaxation and pleasure of sailing.For IIT's, however, the behavior of these liquids and gases in motion is a source of fascination. As a professor of fluid mechanics, Williams studies the dynamics of fluid flow, using mathematical models to better understand complex phenomena. Such research helps him design new ways to modify fluid performance to suit a multiplicity of human needs. Williams' chosen field is also well suited to his twin recreational passions: competitive sailboat racing and piloting small airplanes.A devotion to sailing began early. \"I built my first sailboat when I was 15,\" Williams recalls. Noting some errors in the original plan designs, the youngster made a few modifications. \"I fixed it and it sailed fine. I ended up selling that boat after about a year and buying my first racing boat when I was 16.\"Thus began a 40-year romance with the sport of sailboat racing. So far, Williams has been in three Olympic sailing trials and recently qualified for the World Sailing Championships, to be held in Chicago this June.Williams' fascination with flight also dates from his childhood. \"I grew up on an Air Force base and have always been interested in airplanes,\" he remembers. \"In the '60s there was a lot of excitement about high-speed planes and rockets. I wrote to NASA in fifth grade, asking for information on theproject, and they sent me a big brown folder full of reports and tons of information. That made a big impression on me.\"It wasn't surprising that Williams' boyhood infatuation with boats and airplanes (and the currents of water and air they ride on) stimulated a deep, scientific curiosity. Intrigued by the study of fluid flow, Williams eventually earned both master's and doctorate degrees in fluid dynamics from.At IIT, research on such diverse areas as unsteady aerodynamics, fluid-structure interaction, turbulence, hydrodynamic stability, and aeroacoustics is carried out through the(FDRC), part of the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering. The department's state-of-the-art facilities have been selected as among three National Centers of Excellence by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research., a large wind tunnel with exceptionally high flow qualities, complements other wind tunnels, water channels, and compressor facilities, and possesses formidable computing capabilities. Using FDRC's unsteady flow wind tunnel, for example, Williams is able to carry out real-time simulations of wings in flight.\"Through computer control, we can measure the forces on the wings. We can reproduce how an airplane can fly in the tunnel,\" he explains, adding, \"You're not just holding the model in a fixed position; it's actually going up and down, and pitching.\"A crucial area of Williams' research concerns the efficiency and maneuverability of wings in flight. Such cutting-edge research draws on meticulous examinations of what our insect and avian relatives have been up to for millions of years. This new approach to aeronautic design is sometimes referred to as bio-inspired flight. Williams is pursuing research with participants from, Princeton, andin Boston.Pondering creatures such as dragonflies, hummingbirds, and other master fliers, Williams observes, \"The real question is how these things can fly at all.\" On a recent trip to Pennsylvania, he was captivated by one peculiar specimen, a hovering, hand-sized bird that locals have dubbed the 'helicopter bird.' \"It caught my attention because it appeared to be perfectly stationary and wasn't flapping its wings with any noticeable amplitude. You couldn't build a model airplane of the same size to do that. It was just incredible.\"One of the ways that both birds and insects achieve superlative flight performance is through their ability to generate so-called leading edge vortices. The flight of the, for example, has been studied in considerable detail, Williams says. Swifts use their remarkable aerial dexterity to snatch insects in mid-air. Their ability has to do with the Swift's two-part wing design, consisting of a shorter 'arm wing,' similar to the wing of a conventional airplane, and a longer, swept back 'hand wing,' which is flatter on top, angles toward the rear, and is much sharper, like the wing of a fighter jet.Swifts use their arm wings to generate the leading edge vortices\u2014low pressure zones that create lift. By subtly modifying wing angle, Swifts and other acrobatic birds can alter the ratio of lift to drag, permitting extreme mid-air maneuverability.If some of nature's avian secrets can be applied to human designs, Williams suggests, a new class of startlingly nimble aircraft will emerge. Further, some of these will fit comfortably in the palm of a hand. Known as micro air vehicles, such cyber-birds and insects could be used for a variety of tasks, including search and rescue operations, aerial surveillance, or biological agent detection.Williams' own airborne adventures began eight years ago. \"I teach the junior-level aerodynamics class,\" he explains. \"A friend at Princeton told me he took his students to the airport for intro flights, where they'd get to fly a Cessna 172 for half an hour with an instructor. I thought that was a good idea for our students.\" So Williams learned to fly, beginning with single-engine planes like the Piper Arrow, graduating more recently to a Beach Baron twin engine.Before long, Williams was hooked. With the help of former IIT student Jerome Chiecchio (AE '01), he began ferrying planes to buyers in the U.S. and overseas. One memorable trip brought the pair to Riga, Latvia via Bangor, Maine; Goose Bay, Canada; Greenland; Iceland; Scotland; and Denmark during the course of a six-day odyssey in 2006.These days, Williams would more likely be spotted in the water than in the air, however, as he eagerly prepares for the World Sailing Championships. Williams and his two team members will race a 30-foot \"One-Design\" sailboat in the Etchells Class. One-Designs are built specifically for racing and must conform to rigid hull specifications.Despite this, Williams insists, all boats are not created equal, and newer boats tend to be faster. Williams claims the formula for success relies 60\u201370 percent on the quality of the team and about 30\u201340 percent on the boat. His own team includes two of Williams' longtime sailing companions. \"We do each other's jobs simultaneously. There's a lot of discussion on the boat between us about what we should do next during the race,\" he says.Presently, the three are honing their tactics by studying a rival Chicago contender for the Worlds trophy. \"This guy did very well at the national championships\u2014he's significantly faster than us,\" Williams says, adding, \"We're researching what he's doing that's different and gives him a little bit of an edge.\"When it comes to the art of sailboat racing, Williams tends to downplay his scientific knowledge. \"I have an understanding of what the flow is doing over the sails, but it really doesn't help. The difference between first place and fifth place in a typical race is about 1 percent in performance. I can't tell you on the basis of my knowledge of fluid dynamics or of airfoils what changes would give you that 1 percent. It's kind of trial and error, based on experience of the racecourse.\"Lately, Williams is vigorously rehearsing for race day whenever his teaching and research schedules allow. \"We'll sail unless there's ice in the harbor. We'll begin again in March.\" While a first-place finish at the Worlds would surely electrify the team, Williams is gratified for the opportunity to compete in such a prestigious event. \"A lot of former Olympic and America's Cup sailors race these boats, so it's really good competition at the top levels,\" he says.\"You have to have a first-rate boat, first-rate sails, and a first-rate team. Those are the three essentials to win the World Championships.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2008/making-dream", "content": "Since it was founded in 1890, Illinois Institute of Technology has embraced a progressive view of diversity, welcoming students and faculty of all races and ethnicities, even during years of segregation. Increasing diversity is a priority of the university today, and IIT's African-American alumni, students, and faculty are proving that success is colorblind.As an engineering student at IIT, Frank Crossley could appreciate the value of an experiment. When he joined a United States Navy V-12 Program in 1944 that paid for his tuition and led to a commission as an officer, he became part of the experiment the Navy had no black officers at the time, and the commanding officer of the IIT unit told him the government was interested in testing whether white military personnel would take orders from black officers.It worked. Crossley was assigned to the U.S.S. Storm King at the tail end of World War II, and soon had 36 men reporting to him, including one officer. For two days he felt like a curiosity to his fellow crew members, but soon, he remembers, the enlisted men regarded him like any other officer. A fellow officer even overheard a sailor telling a friend that, \"All the officers on this ship are S.O.B.s except Mr. Crossley.\" Crossley's success, along with that of the other African Americans in the program, influenced President Harry S. Truman to outlaw discrimination in the military in 1948.Crossley's impact didn't stop with the Navy. As a renowned metallurgist at aerospace firm Lockheed Martin in the 1970s, he received a patent for inventing a new class of titanium alloys.Crossley is one of many African-American graduates of IIT who have made landmark contributions in professions ranging from engineering and architecture to law and journalism. Along the way, IIT's African-American alumni have also been at the forefront of the struggle for civil rights in America.First, there are the pioneers. Ida Platt, who earned her law degree from Chicago College of Law in 1894, is believed to be the first African American woman to pass the bar in Illinois. (Chicago College of Law and Kent College of Law merged in 1900, and becamein 1969).Charles Pierce, a 1901 graduate of Armour Institute of Technology, was the nation's first African-American graduate in chemical engineering. Pierce later taught at DuSable High School in Chicago while Crossley was a student there. (Armour merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to create IIT.)Then there's Gloria Ray Karlmark, who had already done her pioneering when she arrived on campus. The 1965 graduate came to IIT from Little Rock, Ark., where she was one of the famed \"Little Rock Nine\", the nine students who attended previously segregatedunder the U.S. Army's protection in 1957.The university's highest-profile African-American alumnus may be Robert Abbott (LAW 1900), who founded the newspaper. Through the Defender, Abbott campaigned against racial injustice; his suggestion that southern blacks move north to escape discrimination helped draw more than 50,000 southern African Americans to Chicago between 1915 and 1920.IIT has consistently graduated African Americans who are leaders in their fields. Other notable alumni include(PA '49), who became Chicago's first black postmaster in 1966;(ID '92), who the New York Times Style Magazine hailed in 2005 as \"the first African American to make an impression on the rarefied world of international industrial design\"; Perri Irmer (ARCH '81), who runs U.S. Cellular Field as chief executive officer of the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority; and(LAW '96), current clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, who became the first African American to hold that position when she was elected in 2000.In the 1940s and 50s, there were fewer black students, but those who attended say the culture at IIT was supportive because they and their work were regarded on par with fellow students, regardless of race.\"I don't know how long I was around IIT until anyone in the administration knew I was black,\" says David Sharpe (ARCH '60, M.S. '62), who came to IIT as a student in 1956 to study under Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and joined IIT's architecture faculty full-time in 1982 after a 20-year career at Chicago architecture firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM). While at SOM Sharpe also taught part-time at IIT. \"[Race] just wasn't something that was important to Mies, so it didn't come up,\" he says.Over time, the university attracted more black students, who supported and challenged one another.\"We had a drive to succeed that came from an understanding that our success or failure would impact the perception of the African-American students who would follow us,\" says Jeff Carroll (ME '94), who works in business development at Siemens Business Technologies in Chicago. \"If a classmate was feeling like they couldn't cut it, we would reach out to them, encourage them, help them with their understanding of the curriculum\u2014whatever it took for all of us to graduate.\"Two important programs that drew minority students to IIT and into the engineering and science professions were initiated in the 1970s and 1980s. IIT's, headed by Nathaniel Thomas, worked to increase the number of African-American students at IIT to nearly 12 percent of the undergraduate student population and Hispanic students to nearly 10 percent. The Early ID program lost federal funding in the late 80s.(CAHMCP, pronounced \"Champs\"), a State of Illinois-sponsored consortium of Chicago-area medical and dental schools, IIT, and several health-focused community groups, was started in 1979. The program works as a pipeline to identify and recruit underrepresented minorities' as early as in the seventh grade into medical professions. Led by Reggie Jones and John Bradley, CAHMCP is housed on IIT Main Campus and continues to serve as a novel approach to minority recruitment.\"Both the Early Identification program and CAHMCP have single-handedly been responsible for IIT's efforts to help create trailblazers in the underrepresented minority population,\" says Kevin Smith (CS '89), executive director of the Office of Multicultural Student Services (OMSS).Some of IIT's African-American alumni, like Crossley, see themselves as barrier breakers and standard bearers for fellow African Americans. Others have viewed race as playing a less predominant part, as Sharpe notes, \"I've never had a desire to be anybody's role model. I'm just interested in doing good work.\" In all cases, they're part of a legacy of success at a university that has long sought to foster limitless discovery and achievement in all of its students.The community of African-American students at IIT is small but close-knit. The university wants to increase its numbers and is looking to do so by both recruiting more minority students and retaining those already studying here through programs that allow them to acclimate and succeed.Local recruitment efforts include partnerships with Chicago Public Schools (CPS), where 52 percent of students are African American. Each semester IIT partners with 8-12 CPS high schools to provide students campus tours that showcase the unique IIT educational experience through lectures and Interprofessional Projects demonstrations. The university also co-hosts college fairs that introduce CPS students and their families to the college admission process. Through the Advanced Mathematics Program, IIT offers Jones College Prep students advanced calculus courses at the university, providing tuition waivers and covering the cost of books. And launched in academic year 2007-08, the Collens Scholarship Program awards full-tuition scholarships to talented CPS graduates whose annual family income is less than $40,000.The(MSED) continues its collaboration with CPS through programs that foster engagement in math and science at the middle school and high school level. The Way2Go summer program introduces science concepts to students entering the eighth grade. In its second year, the CPS High School Transformation project, funded by the, pairs MSED with The Field Museum and Glencoe Publishing to provide teachers professional development in science. Through their teachers' enhanced science knowledge and teaching ability, students obtain an improved understanding and achievement in the subject, and increased awareness of science as a career.For students outside Chicago, IIT's Office of Undergraduate Admission has piloted and plans to expand a Fly-In Program that underwrites the cost of travel, enabling newly admitted students with financial need to visit campus before the beginning of their freshman year. This and other minority recruitment initiatives are being studied and developed by the offices of undergraduate admission and financial aid, and also by a designated subcommittee of the Retention and Student Life Task Force. IIT has also created a new Committee on Diversity, which will take a lead role in improving diversity university-wide.Retention is as important as recruitment, and the Office of Undergraduate Admission in conjunction with the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs is launching a new campaign to help retain minority students. Through a rigorous advising platform, students' academic success and career goals will be monitored, with additional counseling, mentorship, and support services offered for students needing them. On-campus living is also important to these retention efforts, according to Herek Clack, a member of IIT's minority student retention committee and an African-American member of the engineering faculty.\"Our African-American students now are more flexible and better able to maneuver in an environment where there are few students of color than those of my generation. They're reporting that even where they may be the only black student in class, they're reaching out and forming friendships, forming study groups,\" says Clack. \"If you live on campus, you're far more likely to form those social bonds and join those groups.\"Student organizations such as theand IIT'schapter plan social and professional events, and their leaders agree that it is important to build the number of black students who live on campus. Christian Hubbard, a senior architecture major and president of the BSU, says his organization struggles to draw commuter students at its evening events and acknowledges that living on campus helps him feel more connected to IIT.\"I've spent so much time in S. R. Crown Hall\u2014once I put in four all-nighters in a row\u2014and people there with me, the better students in class, have become my friends,\" says Hubbard. \"I see what they're making and hear what they're reading, and that helps make me better.\"Adjusting to college life can be challenging, though, for black students. In addition to the usual adjustments associated with starting college, there can be a significant culture shock.\"Black new students come in with a slight disadvantage because there are not many groups of people on campus they can quickly and easily relate with. They meet faculty and students who are very different from where they came from,\" says Ikechi Emelogu, a senior electrical engineering major and president of IIT's NSBE chapter.Groups like the NSBE and BSU help build that community, in conjunction with the(OMSS), which also provides academic support and other resources. This includes the new High Performance Institute (HiPI), designed to connect underrepresented minorities with academic and co-curricular programs such as academic assistance, cultural enrichment, and social engagements.\"Black students have needs that are different than those of other students\u2014for instance, commuters or students in fraternities. We can't make the mistake of generalizing and not addressing their needs,\" says Kevin Smith. \"As we look at how we recruit black students, we need to make sure we have the resources in place to support them.\"By the time Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute merged in 1940 to create Illinois Institute of Technology, the surrounding Bronzeville neighborhood, once booming in the 1920s following the Great Migration, had fallen hard. Many of its once opulent buildings were in disrepair, victims of the Great Depression. During this time, IIT participated with the City of Chicago in an urban renewal effort that required the razing of many of Bronzeville's legendary structures where Main Campus now sits. Later in the 1950s and '60s, the Chicago Housing Authority built public housing projects like Stateway Gardens and the Robert Taylor Homes at the edge of campus.While the relationship between university administrators and community leaders soured in the mid-1900s, taking on an adversarial tone that persisted for decades, IIT officials later changed their approach. In 1989, the university hired a neighborhood advocate, Leroy Kennedy, to direct the university's community relations efforts. Following the recommendations of the National Commission for IIT, created in 1992, the university decided to work with neighborhood leaders to improve the area and to reinvest in Bronzeville.\"IIT has grown even though the neighborhood has experienced mounting problems,\" says Kennedy, IIT's vice president of community affairs and outreach. \"We have an obligation to help come up with some of the solutions.\"Community leaders say they can feel the difference that's occurred because of the university's new commitment.\"The university has begun to look at the neighborhood as an asset, as something of value, and the students now see the place where they live as a destination\u2014something that adds value to their experience,\" says Leonard McGee, president of the Gap Community Organization, a neighborhood within Bronzeville. McGee cites the new IIT Collens Scholarship Program as a sign of commitment to the neighborhood, as well as a technology-training program for area teachers. \"The university and the community have a symbiotic relationship\u2014arm in arm, we can achieve a level of success that's beyond our reach separately.\"\"The university has stepped up as a partner,\" says Harold Lucas, president of the Black Metropolis Convention and Tourism Council. In March 2007, IIT provided financial support toward a bid to designate parts of Bronzeville as a National Heritage Area, the latest in a series of university-supported projects to benefit the neighborhood. Other initiatives range from providing Web hosting for local community groups to supporting the restoration of some of the remaining historic buildings from Bronzeville's golden age. The housing projects south of Main Campus are gone, replaced by mixed-income housing and retail businesses such as Starbucks that both employ and cater to neighborhood residents.Third Ward Alderman Pat Dowell, whose territory includes Bronzeville, says IIT has fueled the neighborhood's rebirth. She points not only to the university's more visible contributions, like the financial support for the heritage district, but also to the way that university staff have become active in neighborhood groups; IIT students and faculty serve as tutors for area schoolchildren. Says Dowell: \"IIT recognizes its role in the community and reaches beyond its walls to serve.\"It's been more than a half-century since James S. Peters II (M.S. PSYC '52) earned a master's degree from IIT. The 90 year old sometimes needs a wheelchair to get around, but the energy and ideals that propelled him into a successful career as both a clinical/counseling psychologist and professor, as well as toward a lifetime of social justice advocacy, remain undimmed.Peters came to IIT after serving as a specialist teacher psychologist for three years in the United States Navy at the U.S. Naval Training Center in Great Lakes, Ill., in a segregated camp for \"negroes.\" However, in part due to his research on the relationship between black and white sailors, the Navy desegregated its ranks in 1945, three years before President Harry S. Truman ordered the other branches of the military to do so.\"My research showed that African-American sailors, if given the opportunity, could do the same things that white sailors did,\" he says.Peters' passion for civil rights began during his youth. \"We always felt that some day we would have equal citizenship in spite of the Jim Crow laws, segregation, and discrimination,\" says Peters, who was born in Arkansas and grew up in Louisiana. \"We always worked hard to get an education and do the right thing. We were not taught to hate white people because there were a number of very fine whites who resented the fact that we were segregated as we were.\"His experience at IIT was positive. He did not encounter any racial prejudice at the university and was welcomed on campus from the start. \"I was right at home; everyone was so nice to me,\" Peter says of his time at IIT. \"The community seemed to be glad to have me there, and I won't forget it.\"Former Department of Psychology Chair P. S. Shurrager and his wife, who was also a professor, were two of those people. So was Professor David Boder, who supervised Peters' master's thesis about the psychological and social problems of black and white veterans.After graduating from IIT in 1952, Peters spent about a decade with the Veterans Administration in the beginning of a distinguished career as a clinical/counseling psychologist. He also continued to work for social justice, eventually meeting and becoming friends with fabled civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr.Peters' attentions have not been limited to the rights of African Americans. Beginning with his time in the military, Peters also has advocated for the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities. He served for 25 years as associate commissioner of the State Department of Education and state director of vocational rehabilitation for the State of Connecticut.Peters' related concerns of psychological testing and civil rights are reflected in his writings, which cover a wide range of topics. In October 2007 he sent his 26th book to print. In addition to scholarly titles, including a source book of research by black psychologists and Social Justice for the Disabled, Peters has written three memoirs and two books of poetry.He and his late wife, Marie, who was associate professor of family studies at the University of Connecticut, have three children and three grandchildren.Peters has garnered many honors\u2014a particularly noteworthy one came in 2005, when he was named to the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame\u2014and he says that the education he received at IIT played a significant role in his accomplishments.\"It enabled me to continue on for my Ph.D. at Purdue University and post-doctorate work at Harvard University School of Medicine, and practice my profession,\" Peters says. \"Drs.

Then food editor and restaurant critic for the, Lofstrom was conducting a restaurant review in 1978 and mentioned her insatiable thirst as of late to her lunch companion and reporter friend, Thea. \"It was a cloudy day,\" Lofstrom recalls. \"No sunshine, just one of those winter Saturdays when you are hoping spring comes soon.\" After an eighth glass still did not quench Lofstrom' thirst, Thea urged her colleague to leave the restaurant and go to the emergency room.National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases cite that nearly 21 million people in the United States have diabetes mellitus, with close to one-third of this population as of yet undiagnosed. As of 2002, an additional 54 million were estimated to be pre-diabetic, with many of those expected to develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.Meaning \"a siphon,\" the word diabetes was coined by the second-century Greek physician Aretus the Cappadocian, who routinely observed one of the classic symptoms of diabetes - frequent urination - by his patients. A metabolic disorder, diabetes is the result of high levels of sugar in the blood. After food is broken down during the digestive process, sugar in the form of glucose enters the blood, becoming the main source of fuel for the body. In order for glucose to enter the cells, insulin, a hormone produced by the islet cells of the pancreas, must also be present in the blood. In a nondiabetic individual, for glucose absorption to occur, the pancreas automatically produces the correct amount of insulin. In people with diabetes, however, either little or no insulin is produced, or the body's cells do not sufficiently respond to the insulin that is produced (type 2). The consequent build-up of sugar in the blood spills over into the urine and out of the body. A third type of diabetes,, occurs in 3 to 8 percent of women during pregnancy. While gestational diabetes usually disappears after the baby is born, women with this type have a 20 to 50 percent chance of developing type 2 diabetes within five to 10 years.A diagnosis of diabetes is generally made through a fasting blood glucose reading of greater than 126 mg/dc (deciliter) done on two separate occasions. Lofstrom's visit to the ER yielded a blood glucose reading of 650; random blood glucose readings should be below 200 mg/dc. Individuals like Lofstrom with type 1 diabetes are taught to give themselves insulin, from one to four times daily. Continuous-flow insulin pumps, worn at all times, are also available; a new insulin inhaler was given FDA approval in 2006 and can replace some of the daily injections. A program of regular physical activity is prescribed, as insulin balance is achieved by food intake and daily exercise. Blood glucose levels by finger sticks must be done several times daily to ensure that sugar neither rises too high nor drops too low. Type 2 patients are not immediately prescribed insulin for their disease but a treatment plan of exercise, diet modifications, and, if needed, oral drugs that lower the amount of sugar in the blood.Though a veteran of the diabetes regimen of insulin dosing, Lofstrom, now a doctoral candidate at Illinois Institute of Technology and senior manager for corporate communications at the, says the thought of problems arising from so many years of having the disease is never far from her mind. \"Monitoring diabetes is very trying at times for me - and for my family,\" she admits. \"I worry about having high blood sugar so sometimes I over-amp my insulin, which results in low blood sugar.\" Lofstrom credits her family for their constant support and keen observation in providing another level of checks in her proper monitoring of insulin, which she now administers via an insulin pump. They can tell by one word whether or not her levels are askew. \"They know by the way I am talking that it is low. I am used to doing the finger sticks to check my blood sugar, but the worry about the long-term effects never disappears. So far, after almost 30 years with the disease, I am lucky: no complications.\", director of the Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering and chair of IIT's Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME), understands Lofstrom's concerns about her future. \"If you don't keep your glucose levels low, you tend to run into complications 10 or 20 years down the road,\" says Turitto, whose brother has type 1 diabetes. \"By not monitoring sugars well, you end up with a whole host of disorders - advanced cardiovascular disease, loss of kidney function, neuropathies, abnormal wound healing, and blindness.\" Moreover, many type 2 patients develop a need for insulin injection treatment and with the growing numbers of such patients developing this disorder at earlier ages, they are likely to develop the long-term complications associated with type 1 diabetes.IIT faculty-researchers are investigating many of the disorders associated with diabetes at the university's(ECDRE), the first engineering center in the nation to focus on the treatment and cure of diabetes. Formed two years ago, ECDRE is directed by, vice provost for research and professor of chemical and biological engineering (ChBE). It is one of several centers under the Pritzker Institute, which seeks to develop and coordinate relationships with traditional science and engineering departments within IIT, as well as with outside institutions. The ECDRE's collaborative relationships with various institutions, including the University of Chicago (U. of C.), a longtime leader in medical diabetes research, as well as with faculty from Armour College of Engineering, the College of Science and Letters (CSL), the Institute of Psychology, and Chicago-Kent College of Law, distinguish it as being unique in what it is able to offer.One priority initiative being jointly investigated by ECDRE and the U. of C. is on the only \"cure\" currently available for type 1 diabetes patients: the development of a bioartificial pancreas through islet cell encapsulation. Naked pancreatic islet cells from two donor cadavers are injected into the patient's liver, where they lodge in the blood vessels and respond appropriately to sugar levels. \"It has been shown that patients injected with functional islet cells from cadavers will actually become insulin independent; they won't have to inject themselves with insulin,\" says Turitto. \"But the long-term studies are not in yet. Some fail, some are successful. It's not yet clear why they fail, and it's not clear what the maximum lifespan would be.\"U. of C. surgeon Marc Garfinkel, along with Emmanuel Opara, ECDRE associate director and BME research professor, and Seda Kizilel (Ph.D. BME '04) have already published one paper on the topic. Kizilel, now working at U. of C., is spearheading an islet project using biopolymer hydrogels-another ECDRE priority initiative-as a means of encapsulation. Garfinkel has also collaborated with BME Assistant Professor Connie Hall on blood clotting and islet cell transplantation. \"As is demonstrated by these projects, the unique combination of engineering science and biologic science has tremendous potential to impact many diseases, but particularly type 1 diabetes,\" notes, professor of surgery and chief of the Section of Liver Transplantation and Hepatobiliary Surgery at U. of C.Collaboration is also taking place within IIT's traditional science community as researchers from Armour and CSL have joined to study type 1 diabetes. An interdisciplinary team that includes BME Assistant Professor Eric Brey and Jialing Xiang, assistant professor of biology, and Rong Wang, associate chair of the Department of Biological, Chemical, and Physical Sciences and associate professor of chemistry, is advancing bioartificial pancreas research through two projects: differentiating human embryonic stem cells into functional, insulin-producing islet cells and developing novel cell encapsulation methods for islet cell delivery. The project is one of nearly 30 funded by Pritzker Institute seed grants over the past two years.Collaboration is also taking place within IIT's traditional science community as researchers from Armour and CSL have joined to study type 1 diabetes.

The project is one of nearly 30 funded by Pritzker Institute seed grants over the past two years.Last summer, IIT was one of five institutions selected to share a $20 million court award from the settlement of a consumer class-action lawsuit challenging the effectiveness of the diabetes drug Rezulin. The windfall benefits the, a collaboration of the ECDRE and two organizations within Chicago-Kent\u2014the(ISLAT) and the Health and Disability Law Clinic.\"Medicine has become more and more quantitative over the past 15 years, and the reliance on disciplines such as engineering and the physical sciences has become stronger\"\u00a0\u2014Vince Turitto, IITDirected by Lori Andrews, Distinguished Professor of Law, ISLAT undertakes research and disseminates information on the implications and applications of medical and scientific technologies within societal and legal contexts. Among the ethical issues associated with diabetes are patient privacy, intellectual property rights of patients, patents on human genes, and the funding of research and recruitment of subjects for studies. Part of the Rezulin funding will go toward developing overall policy recommendations on facilitating access to treatment, insurance coverage, and related government benefits, and to examining the conflicts that arise among competing interests of patients, diabetes researchers, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and the public health community. \"Lori sees the value in looking at scientific research and engineering development, and matching how intellectual contributions should facilitate solutions as opposed to being barriers,\" says Cinar.Through the funding, Chicago-Kent's Health and Disability Law Clinic, directed by Associate Professor Ed Kraus, will provide a wide spectrum of pro bono legal advocacy for its clients with diabetes and diabetes-related disabilities who are discriminated against and/or denied access to appropriate medical treatment. The award will also help to develop and support a Web-based advice center for patients and family members, giving them access to information, resources, and a guide to the various application processes necessary for acquiring benefits and treatments.According to Cinar, the funds earmarked to further diabetes research through the ECDRE are helping expand efforts in three core areas \"where IIT would make its major contributions.\" The first is in the continued development of biomaterials used both as hydrogel protective coverings for islet cell encapsulation and as the coating of drug-delivering microcapsules useful for patients on long-term therapy, a project being investigated by a joint IIT ChBE, Pritzker, and BME team that includes faculty members Victor Perez-Luna, Fouad Teymour, and Opara. Funding will also go toward researching biomaterials as a type of scaffolding useful in wound healing and tissue generation, spearheaded by Brey. His efforts are being combined with the use of hydrogels in the development of new tissue engineering methods for treating diabetic ulcers, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic wounds.A second core area is the prevention of vascular complications that arise from having diabetes. \"Diabetes tends to be what we call a microvascular disease,\" explains Turitto. \"Small vessels get injured and damaged, and actually disappear.\" Cinar agrees with his colleague. \"The sneaky thing with diabetes is when it starts affecting the vascular system it doesn't start with a major artery that would be signaling early in the game that something is wrong. It will start with the tiniest vessels whose effects are not readily noticeable.\" When the effects do become noticeable, however, they make themselves apparent in a devastating way. As nerves die, individuals lose their sense of cold and heat, resulting in increased chances for frostbite and burns. Wounds are slower to heal because the restorative properties of microcirculation are absent. Once the larger vessels do become affected, accelerated atherosclerosis sets in, which could result in gangrene and eventual limb amputation.\"As is demonstrated by these projects, the unique combination of engineering science and biologic science has tremendous potential to impact many diseases, but particularly type 1 diabetes,\" \u2014J. Michael Millis, University of ChicagoVascular problems are also observed in the kidneys, where vessels narrow and become damaged. \"Half of all patients on dialysis are diabetics who've lost kidney function,\" says Turitto, noting that ECDRE faculty are working with members of the U. of C. dialysis clinic on this aspect of the diabetes problem. A final vascular complication resulting from high levels of sugar in the blood is diabetic retinopathy, or blindness. Jennifer Kang Derwent, BME associate professor, is leading a group that is measuring and analyzing variations in dynamic blood flow in the vessels of the eye, and collaborating on an ocular drug-delivery system with William Mieler, professor and chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science at U. of C.The third area under the ECDRE to benefit from the Rezulin award addresses the metabolic aspects of diabetes\u2014how the body uses digested food for growth and energy\u2014especially as it relates to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Cinar believes that education is key to one's awareness of how diet, exercise, and possibly insulin therapy all play a role in successful diabetes management. To that end, the ECDRE is developing Web-based glucose simulators, diet-planning software, and an online food and exercise diary useful to patients and nutritionists. K\u201312 teachers have taken diabetes and nutrition education into their classrooms across the Chicago area in a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Research Experience for Teachers program where they develop a diabetes education module over a seven-week period in one of the ECDRE's research laboratories. And for the past two summers, promising undergraduate students from IIT and around the country have participated in a NSF-funded program that paired them with ECDRE mentors working on various diabetes-related projects.With a solid base in Armour College of Engineering and through interdisciplinary, collaborative relationships with law, the sciences, and medicine\u2014the ECDRE is positioned to make substantial contributions to diabetes research and education, now and in the years to come. The partnership between IIT and the U. of C. is one that is mutually beneficial, allowing for opportunities that may not be possible if each institution were working alone. \"Establishing key partnerships with our engineering colleagues at IIT will allow us to explore enabling technologies that merge molecular biology with biomedical engineering science,\" says Jeffrey B. Matthews, Dallas B. Phemister Professor and chair of the U. of C. Department of Surgery. \"Such efforts create a unique synergy in which new approaches to surgical treatments can be realized and in which novel lines of inquiry can be developed.\"As fields such as medicine evolve and expand in uncharted directions, the opportunity for mutually beneficial partnerships develops. \"Medicine has become more and more quantitative over the past 15 years, and the reliance on disciplines such as engineering and the physical sciences has become stronger as the need for new techniques and devices arise to better detect, treat, and help cure disease,\" says Turitto. \"Biomedical engineering promises to change the practice of medicine in the coming century much as traditional engineering sciences have changed our society over the past 100 years.\"Rong Wang [see article] believes the diabetes effort on which she is collaborating is unique, in part because of contributions being made by the interdisciplinary team of IIT biologists, chemists, biomedical engineers, and mechanical engineers. All will be indispensable in helping to accomplish the project's early two goals: the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into functional pancreatic islet cells and the development of novel cell encapsulation technologies for cell delivery to effectively reduce or eliminate the patient's rejection of the cells, a problem commonly encountered in currently existing stem cell therapies.\"The growth of stem cells in the human body relies on a micro-environment, so-called physiological niches, within the tissue,\" explains Wang. \"The tissue is actually exerting forces to the cell; the cell receives the signal, which significantly impacts the decision-making along a certain differentiation path.\" One task for Wang's interdisciplinary team is to prepare just the right tissue substrate for differentiation to occur. \"Engineers know how to manipulate materials to make this structure,\" she says, \"and scientists determine what that material should be.\" Wang acknowledges that many challenges need to be addressed, including how to control cellular growth to prevent tumor formation and determining the best method for islet cell delivery, but is confident her collaborative team is well-equipped to find solutions.\"We need the scientists and the engineers working together,\" she says. \"I feel that it's really important.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2009/leave-only-footsteps", "content": "When he was a kid, Raymond Ballard (CHE, 4year) wanted to be a veterinarian. When he was in his teens, he thought about becoming an airline pilot. But in high school, he met a physics teacher who changed all that.\"His name was Bill Ennis, and he was inspirational,\" says Ballard, smiling. \"He had a great career, including working in a particle accelerator lab at. He gave it up to teach high school physics. He said if he could get 20 students to do what he had done, his impact on science would be 20 times greater.\"After several of Ennis's graduates attended IIT and gave the university glowing reports, he began to suggest the university to his juniors and seniors. At least one has enrolled at IIT every year since. But Ballard's path is somewhat unusual. His triumvirate of passions includes his major,; his minor,; and his avocation, community service. After graduation Ballard intends to return to his native Alaska to work in engineering and then enter law school, possibly at.\"There's a lot of law involved in working with engineering companies,\" Ballard says. \"It's important to understand the technical aspects of what they're doing. There's patent work, dealing with renewable energy, working with the oil and gas industries. They need so much legal work, and most lawyers don't have a technical background. There are lots of opportunities.\" Eventually, he hopes to meld his passions and enter politics.Ballard's commitment to community service stems from his many years in the, where, at age 17, he became an Eagle Scout. It's a rank attained by just 2 percent of all scouts, including such accomplished men as,, and.Following one of the Boy Scouts tenets of providing service to others, Ballard began working on roadside cleanup and canned-food drives at as early as age 11. \"I helped churches construct things that would sustain them, like a storage shed,\" he says, sounding matter of fact, as though it were something every sixth grader would do.Scouting significantly impacted his life in more than one way. When he was 17, he and his troop went to a Scout Jamboree, an event that brings together 35,000 scouts from all over the world. It was extremely hot, and Ballard joined several adults in erecting a large tent in order to keep the scouts cool. As they lifted the tent, a pole struck a power line, killing four of the leaders. \"It was terrifying,\" Ballard says quietly. \"Their kids were there. One of the leaders was the camp director, so just about every scout knew him. These men were all 150 percent committed to scouting, to making sure we were the best people we could possibly be. It was horrible.\"After that I told myself I would do everything possible to get everything out of life that I could.\"The following year Ballard became active in his high school's student government and more involved with community organizations.When he enrolled at IIT, he joinedand was selected president last year. According to Erin Gray, director of, Ballard helped revitalize Scarlet Fever, a group within the Union Board that promotes athletic events on campus. He became a familiar figure, walking around campus with face paint to remind students of that evening's game. \"Ray is at the forefront of getting students involved in IIT and making it a better place,\" says Gray. \"He's a good role model, and a good representative of the student body.\"Ballard laughs when he thinks about the face paint. \"It's not just about the fun and games,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, we know that our name is only as good as our institution. When we graduate, we need to make sure that every graduating student feels the same way and commits 110 percent to bettering the institution back home and bettering the name of IIT abroad.\"William Grimshaw, professor of political science, says Ballard's dedication to developing campus life, in terms of encouraging students to become engaged and involved, is something faculty and administrators can't do. \"He has an extraordinary commitment to enriching campus life,\" Grimshaw states. \"It's a daunting task to get IIT students away from their computers, and Ray has had to struggle. But he never lets it get him down.\"Ballard emphasizes that he's still growing. One of the things he likes most about IIT is that rather than concentrating on learning facts and methods, he learns how to think. \"Teachers aren't as concerned with me getting everything 100 percent right; they're trying to teach me to think like an engineer,\" he says. He talks enthusiastically about the(IPRO) program for the same reasons. For his course last year, his team of students studied the process model of a coal-fired power plant and recommended a solution that would effectively eliminate liquid waste.\"We learned how to research and analyze. We ultimately developed not just an effective design, but a financially feasible design,\" he says. For Ballard, it was more than an academic requirement and a valuable exercise in teamwork. \"With a group of 10 people, you encounter all kinds of personalities and situations, and you learn to deal with them. Some people weren't committed to the project. Some were pretty domineering. There were varying levels of expertise. You have to learn how to work together.\"In addition to his IPRO project and engineering and political science coursework, Ballard has had other opportunities to hone his leadership skills at IIT\u2014his latest as 2009\u201310 president of the(SGA). As SGA president, he wants to make it easier for students to share issues with the SGA, to promote what the organization has already accomplished, and to inform the student body about the SGA's agenda. He says, however, that change is often slow in coming. \"Student government is like real government. It takes a long time for change. And you're never going to make everybody happy, but you have to keep trying and you have to keep the long-term in mind.\"And as he continues on his path, both at IIT and after graduation, Ballard says community service will always be a guiding force. He remembers a longtime scouting tenet: when you go into the wilderness, leave only footprints behind. \"I always want to be in a place where I can connect with people,\" he says. \"And wherever I go, I want to leave it better than when I arrived.\"The IIT Office of Student Life offers more than 70 organizations for student involvement, including clubs based on nationality, religion, majors, and Greek life, in addition to common interests. The following is just a sample.for the full list.IIT Student Government Association:IIT Leadership Academy:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2009/passion-ignited-lifetime-learning", "content": "path to dean of IITwas paved with inspiration, dedication, and\u2014toothpaste. DePaola recalls that when she was 8 years old and growing up in Venezuela, she eagerly looked forward to weekly visits to her grandmother Rosa's home along the shores of the Caribbean Sea. DePaola dearly loved her grandma and told her that she was preparing a remedy to help fade the age spots beginning to appear along Rosa's hands and arms. On Sunday afternoons, DePaola retreated into her bedroom closet, where she had set up a tiny chemistry laboratory and mixed together dollops of various emulsions and ointments from her family's medicine cabinet, which she thinned with rubbing alcohol. One special ingredient was toothpaste.She would let the preparation settle, bottle the precipitate, and present her efforts to Rosa, who reported that the cream was indeed working. Of course, it was not. But Rosa knew that her granddaughter was a budding scientist and didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.As DePaola grew up, her interest in science developed, moving from chemistry into physics and mathematics. A self-described \"nerdy high school student,\" she was glued to the television, watching Public Broadcasting System science shows, but was also popular with her peers, and even tutored many of them in math during her junior and senior years. DePaola continued to serve as a high school math and physics tutor during all her years at, where she was a mechanical engineering major and physics teaching assistant. In college, her interests took her in the direction of biomedicine, and she spent countless hours in the college library reading about advances in the field.DePaola left South America to enter the master's program in mechanical engineering at(MIT), where she focused on the flow of biofluids and its applications for intravenous therapies and injections. She was one of only 10 people yearly admitted into the doctoral program in medical engineering and medical physics jointly offered by MIT and, and graduated with her Ph.D. in 1991.\"I think that really was the best time of my life,\" says DePaola. \"I had superb research mentors who were not only wonderful scientists but also really extraordinary individuals who care about students?their education, career, and life success. I constantly try to live up to what I learned from my mentors and try to be for my students what my mentors were for me,\" she says.In her dually historic role as Armour's first female dean and first Hispanic dean, which she began on August 1, DePaola looks forward to mentoring many students, though not primarily because of either her gender or her race.\"I'm fully committed to diversity, but I believe that you don't need to be a minority to be fully committed,\" she says. \"It's something that comes with the person; not with the gender. In fact, many of the main advances in support of making diversity happen were made by people who are not in minority groups. But they have a shared commitment and passion for diversity, which I think is a very important component in an academic institution, particularly at IIT, being a part of Chicago. The strategic plan of the university speaks to diversity very well.\"The new dean says that the structure of theplan\u2014with its emphasis on IIT's values and core principles\u2014will make her job of crafting Armour's strategic plan and aligning it with the university's an easy one, and is at the top of her to-do list.\"I'll be looking at the strength of the faculty and how we can go beyond where we are right now, exploring ways for the faculty to grow and how we can support that for higher achievement,\" she says. \"It's crucial that we determine what those unique aspects of an IIT Armour College of engineering education are and get the word out.\", associate dean for graduate studies and medical student research at, worked with DePaola on the development of inter-institutional programs between the college and(RPI), where DePaola served most recently as chair of theHe says that DePaola has the ability to quickly see the opportunities and importance of innovation in education.\"She eagerly did the 'heavy lifting' in developing our new combined-degree program (B.S./M.D.); she recognized the exciting opportunity that our two institutions could offer, and she prioritized the needs of the students in the development of the new program,\" explains Andersen. \"She made a lasting contribution, and I believe that our students will make an important impact on the health care needs of the country over the next several decades because of what Natacha did here.\"Considering IIT's goal to increase the number of female undergraduate and graduate students over the next five years, DePaola is hoping to offer Armour outreach programs targeted to girls in grades five through eight. She also plans to support role models among female faculty members to open young minds to engineering and science as being career possibilities and disciplines that are eminently exciting.The intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm for knowledge and discovery that took root during DePaola's own middle school years continue to define her personality today.\"The thrill is in discovering how we can use our knowledge of physics, engineering, and mathematics to understand disease better and to develop new therapies to treat disease,\" she says. \"If you can do something that will improve the quality of life and that will help patients\u2014I think that's what motivates a lot of biomedical engineers. The tools that we have now, we didn't have 20 or even 10 years ago. The advances that have been made and the knowledge of biology we have now are fantastic.\"DePaola's longtime research, which earned her aFaculty Early Career Development Award during her 15-year tenure at RPI, focuses on cellular mechanics, biofluid dynamics, and tissue engineering. In 1996, DePaola's revelation that cumulative wear and tear on our arteries by the impact of flowing blood means that we all will face some degree of arteriosclerosis was picked up by. Her findings showed that the damage occurs where arteries bend sharply or branch with the impaired flow perhaps triggering the disease. She continues to devote the bulk of her research efforts to finding a solution for preventing arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.While DePaola knows that her dean duties will leave her less time in the laboratory, she plans to continue her research collaborations with colleagues at RPI and Albany Medical College, and to form new collaborations with researchers at IIT and other institutions in the Chicago area. She and, assistant professor in RPI's Department of Biomedical Engineering, are working on a neural tissue engineering project, trying to understand the process whereby stem cells give rise to neural tissue, which the researchers have found seems to greatly depend upon the influence of neighboring vasculature.DePaola and surgeons from Albany are also pursuing new treatments for osteoporosis, looking at how the physical environment can serve as a tool for modulating the metabolism of the bone-forming cells so that therapies could potentially be developed. The team is investigating ways to affect the differentiation of stem cells into bone cells using a combination of biological and physical stimuli, and how to improve the odds of their integration within the body by isolating and pre-treating the cells outside of the body.While DePaola admits to being \"data-driven,\" maintaining that the successful outcome of a project depends upon detailed information gathering, proper analysis, and careful consideration of all the parameters, she firmly believes in the human component.\"You always need to make sure that everybody who has a stake in the project is included,\" says DePaola. \"It's important to get their input and try to see things from their perspective.\"DePaola has practiced this people approach since she put herself in her grandmother's shoes as a little girl concerned about the appearance of age spots. And the influence of so many of her family members has reinforced this approach and the importance of DePaola's role as an educator: her mother, a retired professor of physics and mathematics; her father, an economist; her grandfather, who founded a preparatory school; her aunt, another educator; and her husband,, who joins DePaola at IIT as a professor in the.In fact, it was the human component that sold DePaola on IIT when she came to Main Campus for her interview.\"The level of excitement that people have about Armour College and the level of commitment that everyone has linked into the community gave me reason to believe that this would be a great opportunity,\" she says. \"I met with students and faculty, and with some of the trustees whose support and enthusiasm toward the institution and engineering is breathtaking. Everybody is ready to contribute and make it happen. I'm very excited. There are a lot of expectations of the dean of engineering, and I'm up to the task.\"More OnlineAmerican Heart Association:National Osteoporosis Foundation:National Science Foundation:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2009/many-voices-one-vision", "content": "The closing sentence of the executive summary of IIT's new strategic plan,(MVOV), is short on words but long on determination. While planning documents serve to outline the goals, aspirations, and projections for an institution's success, the most powerful words are those that say, unequivocally, that the success will be achieved. The \"will\" gives rise to a way.\"is a detailed plan with ambitious objectives, but its success is well within our reach if we remain positive,\" says IIT President John Anderson. \"The tone of the plan\u2014as much as the tenets of the plan\u2014sends a strong message to the IIT community that we are committed to achieving excellence.\"The planning process began in February 2008 with the convening of a working session of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees. This led to the assembly of the MVOV steering committee\u2014consisting of students, faculty, staff, and alumni\u2014headed by Vice President for Business and Administration John Collins, and Associate Professor of Physics and Chair of the Faculty Council Christopher White. The steering committee held informational sessions about MVOV, which outlined the plan's goals and objectives, and in summer 2008 invited members of the IIT community to contribute ideas about what they believe the university's strengths and future priorities should be. During summer 2008, the committee reviewed more than 300 suggestions from 660 people who registered online to be a part of the process.The steering committee consolidated these ideas into a concise report. Meanwhile, the university's academic deans and a group of student leaders each also authored reports on the critical issues facing IIT. The three reports were shared with IIT senior administrators and trustees, and have helped to shape the plan, which was approved May 28, 2009, by the Board of Trustees.\"We were convinced that the strategic plan would only succeed if we engaged and embraced all of the constituencies within the broader university community and opened ourselves up to unconventional thinking,\" says White. \"The process used by the steering committee was difficult, yet the struggles proved fruitful in the end. We were eventually able to avoid a traditional planning process and draft a truly innovative report.\"\"I am impressed by how so many members of the IIT community were engaged in helping to identify these priorities. Their level of input was unprecedented,\" says David Baker, vice president for external affairs and director of the Office of Institutional Strategy, which was established in January 2008 to lead the MVOV effort.The university priorities developed through the plan emphasize distinctive, value-added educational programs, interdisciplinary research based on university-wide themes, initiatives that inspire innovation and excellence among faculty and staff, and investment in engineering and science. Underlying the other priorities is a commitment and plan to assure long-term financial strength. All the priorities are intended to position IIT to attain its ultimate goal: to be an internationally recognized university.Woven throughout the MVOV report, and reflected in the priorities, are several values and core principles intended to guide the IIT community as it works to implement the plan. Driving toward a culture that embraces change, these values and principles include focusing on students, strengthening the faculty and staff, engaging alumni, and making a commitment to a diverse and inclusive community of scholars and innovators.The plan offers some time-proven objectives and action steps aimed at improving upon ongoing efforts. There is a continued focus on Chicago as a partner in education and research, interdisciplinary coursework and research, and steps toward greater financial solvency and flexibility.But MVOV also offers a unique set of constructs that are intended to help distinguish IIT from other institutions of higher education.To begin, IIT is aiming internationally. While this encompasses both the vision and the core principle of heightening visibility, it also addresses more specifically proposed new initiatives such as the International Academy. In addition, efforts to further enhance interdisciplinary research, particularly of topics of global significance, and the priority of elevating the engineering discipline, are expected to boost the university's relevancy in the global arena. Two interdisciplinary research themes\u2014Energy and Sustainability, and Improving the Quality of Life\u2014have been selected, and at least two other priority themes will be determined in the coming months.Another new concept, the Innovation Sandbox, is outlined in the vision and priorities, and rooted in the university's Bauhaus legacy, which places a premium on innovation, creativity, and new technology. To be developed over time, the Innovation Sandbox will serve as a virtual studio intended to generate and promote new ideas. An incentives program will encourage students and faculty to develop creative initiatives that will benefit society and the university.Similarly, the strategic priority of promoting innovation and excellence throughout the university taps IIT's \"many voices\" as a resource. MVOV calls for increased university-wide participation of all members of the IIT community in order to usher the plan's success. This includes improving faculty and staff retention, customer service, and campus operations, and introducing new survey tools and efforts to reward quality work.Also new is the context in which education is defined. More than just bettering academic programs and recruiting talented students, MVOV aims to prepare students for change\u2014producing graduates who are open and creative thinkers with relevant skills developed through enhanced IIT Leadership Academy and Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) courses, and development of the new International Academy.\"We want to provide our students every tool possible to be experts in their chosen discipline and to have the confidence to advance society,\" says Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Alan Cramb. \"That means offering students challenging and relevant courses and research projects that stimulate creativity. We will teach our graduates how to think in many ways\u2014as an engineer, a scientist, a lawyer, a designer, an architect, a psychologist, and as a business person\u2014all of which will help them see the world from multiple perspectives and prepare them for a life of reaction to change.\"In shaping the university's new priorities over the past 16 months, \"we looked to our core strengths while also redefining the university of the future,\" says Anderson. His paper on this two-tiered approach, \"Innovation in a Technology-Oriented University: IIT as an Innovative Studio,\" was posted on the MVOV website for discussion during the planning stage. \"We need to focus on the areas where we can make the biggest impact, but we also must wholly encourage freedom of thought and innovation if we are to make lasting improvements.\"Stay informed of IIT's development and implementation of thestrategic plan in upcoming issues of IIT Magazine and on the MVOV website,. Online, you can also read posts to the MVOV Reading Room, which include thought-provoking articles and discussion about strategic planning, a subscription list for updates on MVOV progress, and a forum where the IIT community can discuss the plans.The last major strategic plan to be implemented at IIT was the Report of the National Commission for IIT, released in 1994. The report, written by IIT trustees, outside experts, and faculty and administrative leaders, was published during a particularly difficult time in the university's financial history.\"During the National Commission, IIT was in grave condition,\" says Baker, who served as executive director of the commission. The group's recommendations emphasized making enrollment more competitive and selective, and addressing IIT's location and fiscal concerns. This led to the Camras Scholars program, the IPRO program, and a capital campaign that also helped to finance new buildings and facilities improvements.\"IIT is in a different place now, thanks to the outcomes of the National Commission,\" says Baker. \"Because of it, IIT has grown stronger in the past decade and is in a position where its can prioritize innovation and taking the university to the next level. Creative ideas such as the Innovation Sandbox would not have been feasible in 1994.\"With MVOV slated for deployment through 2014, ultimate measurement of its success is five years away. Only then will its metrics\u2014which outline everything from minority faculty recruitment and research expenditures to retention and successful customer transactions\u2014reveal its outcomes.\"I am confident that we have developed a plan that is attainable and that reflects the goals and aspirations of the IIT community at large,\" Anderson says. \"Our university has all the potential to be a leader in developing ideas and graduates that will have an impact on the professions and future technology.\"IIT's new vision and mission were developed during thestrategic planning process.IIT will be internationally recognized in distinctive areas of education and research, using as its platform the global city of Chicago, driven by a professional and technology-oriented focus, and based on a culture of innovation and excellence.To provide distinctive and relevant education in an environment of scientific, technological, and professional knowledge creation and innovation.website:The \"Blue Ocean\" approach to creating unique markets, in Harvard Business Review: www.courtenayhr.com/images/Blue%20Ocean%20Strategy.pdf\"Innovation in a Technology-Oriented University: IIT as an Innovative Studio\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/observatory-focuses-our-earth", "content": "It seems appropriate that Dennis Roberson's office at IIT's Main Campus is high up, 10 floors atop street level and competing with the upper-tier seats at U.S. Cellular Field, which commands the view from the office's west windows. While being eye-level with Canada geese flying in formation can be a memorable experience, the real action takes place 12 floors above\u2014on the roof of IIT Tower\u2014where the world's first and only continuously running terrestrial spectrum observatory is installed, and co-directed by Roberson.The observatory is actually an assemblage of antennae, each having its own frequency range, that detect electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves emitted from earth-bound devices such as cell phones, television transmitters, microwave ovens, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AM/FM/satellite radio, police and fire radios, and garage door openers. A main group captures signals from Chicago's Loop and some as far away as Milwaukee; a second group can be directed toward any point on the compass and reaches the city's collar suburbs and across the lake into Michigan. The waves are transformed into visible data via a spectrum analyzer and have yielded valuable information about usage that Roberson and his team are studying to determine how to make the most of the radio spectrum, that part of the electromagnetic spectrum that corresponds to radio frequencies.\"What should impress you most about this chart is that the entire spectrum is allocated,\" says Roberson, unrolling a large, laminated United States Frequency Allocations graph of the radio spectrum with blocks of color corresponding to areas of the chart assigned for services ranging from land mobile to broadcasting to radio astronomy. The Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share allocation responsibilities; the FCC administers the spectrum for non-federal use and the NTIA determines use by the armed services and other federal agencies.\"There's no spectrum left and yet creative minds have not stopped working, so there are new spectrum-hungry applications that are emerging on a monthly or even daily basis,\" Roberson explains. \"The challenge is to figure out where to put the applications; the key is to find out not what is allocated but what's actually being used.\"The FCC and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly aware that the radio spectrum is inefficiently utilized, a fact that has been substantiated by the IIT team after more than two years of collecting data. This fact has also caught the attention of Congress, where both the House and the Senate are working on bipartisan bills to require a regular spectrum-usage census for U.S. radio frequency usage.While the radio spectrum extends from 3kHz\u2013300GHz on the electromagnetic spectrum, Roberson notes that most of the signals coming into the terrestrial observatory are in the 30MHz\u20136GHz range and are populated by devices commonly used at work, at home, and by various commercial and public-safety organizations. In fact, in the Chicago area overall, most of the spectrum is not very heavily used, especially in the higher-frequency ranges, thereby making that chunk a prime site for new applications that require spectrum. The team is also able to see usage by time. Between midnight and 4 a.m., for example, cell phone base stations are powered down, as usage is at a minimum. Over the Christmas weekend, there was a very low level of radio usage by public safety organizations, Roberson says.Roberson\u2014who also serves as IIT's vice provost for new initiatives and as a research professor in computer science\u2014along with observatory co-directors Cynthia Hood, associate chair and associate professor of computer science, and Kenneth Zdunek (Ph.D. EE '91), senior research scholar in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, were inspired in part to initiate the observatory, a National Science Foundation-funded project, because of an emerging technology known as cognitive radio. A \"smart\" form of wireless communication, the radio can sense its environment and utilize that part of the spectrum that though allocated, is not in use.\"It says that, in effect, I can now legally live in your home [spectrum band] with the only restriction being that I can never be there when you are and regardless of what I do with your home while I'm there, I have to return it to exactly how it was when you left it,\" explains Roberson, adding that the topic of ever-increasing new demands on spectrum space that was allocated years ago for older applications is huge, ongoing, and profitable. Roberson recalls that in 2008, the FCC obtained nearly $20 billion in bids on a 700MHz block it had freed up.\"The spectrum observatory is providing the data that helps to inform these debates,\" says Roberson, who has recently applied for a pair of three-year NSF grants to pursue additional spectrum-related studies. \"We're becoming very competent in this area and we are regarded, happily, as world experts in this particular domain.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2009/all-consideration", "content": "As an internationally known expert in chemical-reaction technology and process scale-up with,(CHE '73) has traveled the world. Among a veritable bazaar of mementos from his visits to faraway lands, on display in his office at Dow headquarters in Midland, Michigan, is a marble elephant Kohlbrand purchased in India. Within the elephant is carved a smaller elephant and within that one, an elephant that is smaller yet. What gives the piece its unique appeal, says Kohlbrand, is the artistic rendering of all three elephants together, forming a most interesting whole.\"In a country like the United States, where we sometimes take for granted much of what we have,\" he says, \"being able to think about other places is oftentimes a thought-provoking reminder that you shouldn't just look at how things may have changed since yesterday, but look instead at the absolute situation and appreciate it.\"Taking a global view\u2014both literally and philosophically\u2014is something that Kohlbrand has been doing since his days at IIT, when he quickly discovered that to perform well on his thermodynamics quizzes, he would need to understand and apply both prior learning and new lessons. It is a vision Kohlbrand has also adopted as incoming president of the(AIChE), where he has garnered a reputation for finding answers based on his longtime involvement with the organization and his progressive attitude. Kohlbrand will begin his presidency in 2010 after serving this year as president-elect.\"Hank Kohlbrand's experience with AIChE over the past 30-plus years, coupled with his leadership skills and forward thinking, will provide AIChE with a truly outstanding president,\" says, Vennema Professor ofat theand AIChE president. \"I have observed firsthand how Hank defines and thinks through the tough problems AIChE is facing and then suggests innovative solutions.\"Besides continuing the strategy begun by his predecessor, Kohlbrand will work to increase AIChE membership, keep programs timely and relevant, and ensure that activities accommodate an ever-broadening definition of chemical engineering\u2014one that places more emphasis on biotechnology, sustainability, and process safety, for example. He says that today's chemical engineers also need to recognize the great impact they can have on addressing some of the world's major social issues.\"Solutions to the problem of having potable water, for example, will reside in many cases with the chemical engineer taking scientific principles and putting them into action, analyzing processes and equipment,\" says Kohlbrand, Dow's global(R&D) director of engineering and process sciences in core R&D. \"There's a societal aspect whereby if you could take away the burden of having potable water, it will allow people to spend their time on other things that will improve their lives.\"Through its, AIChE is involved in projects to convert solar, wind, and ocean wave energy into forms that are accessible and affordable. Youth outreach and teacher mentoring is another focus area of the institute, as AIChE looks for ways to encourage K-12 students to consider careers in engineering, science, and mathematics as well as provide them with an outlet to address their sense of social consciousness and satisfy their yearnings to make a difference in the health of the planet. AIChE members and student chapters have joined with the groupon various projects, which gives chemical engineering students the opportunity to work together as a team with students in other engineering disciplines to help solve critical problems affecting developing global communities.\"Being able to think about other places is oftentimes a thought-provoking reminder that you shouldn't just look at how things may have changed since yesterday, but look instead at the absolute situation and appreciate it.\"Kohlbrand recalls his own experience as part of a Dow engineering team whose effective internal collaboration produced an innovation of far-reaching benefit. In 1974\u2014the year that Kohlbrand became a Dow employee\u2014he and some 20 colleagues began searching for ways to more safely work with materials that were stored in large quantities at Dow, a multibillion-dollar diversified science and technology corporation. The team's four-year effort resulted in the accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC\u2122), designed to simulate runaway chemical reactions in large containers such as railcars, storage tanks, or even chemical reactors. The calorimeter went through a series of patents, was commercialized in 1978, and won several industry honors, including the John C. Vaaler Award, the A. O. Beckman Award, and two R&D 100 Awards, which qualifies a product as being one of the most innovative ideas of the year.Kohlbrand led the sub-team that converted data from the ARC to predict real-world scenarios as well as the efforts to license the invention to a company that heard about the calorimeter and wanted to develop a commercial version.\"Many people who use scientific instruments only see the final product,\" says Kohlbrand, who is chair of the. \"They don't realize that when something is new, it doesn't look elegant\u2014it doesn't have nice paint or flashy dials. The calorimeter was really kind of an ugly thing when we first started. It was actually designed to blow up; that's one of the reasons you get such good data,\" he adds with a chuckle, noting that the tiny ARC only held about 10 grams, or 10 cc, of sample but was contained within a mini-refrigerator-sized safety containment. \"The process of watching the calorimeter evolve\u2014from a concept to a device that worked to a commercial entity that turned out to be very successful\u2014was quite an eye-opening experience.\"With the ARC still in use at many companies, Kohlbrand is now largely responsible for determining which projects Dow is capable of undertaking in the areas of process chemistry, process development, reaction engineering, modeling, fluid mechanics and mixing, process separations, and solids processing. He also plays a significant role in managing interactions between R&D and manufacturing, focusing on the development of new products and process technology.High-priority projects Kohlbrand's division is developing include alternative feed stocks, such as the use of plant oils as chemical feed stocks; green chemistry procedures; process synthesis, intensification, and reliability analyses; integrated photovoltaic cells; coal-to-chemicals conversion; water purification methods; and a number of new product proprietary projects for Dow's many clients.\"The scope of what we can do today has increased tremendously,\" says Kohlbrand, about the changes he has seen in business and technology over the course of his career. \"Our ability to use computer modeling to enhance our experimental programs has allowed us to fundamentally change the way that we develop technology and understand science. We can use computers to explore many different design options for a plant instead of putting together one design and tediously going through calculations by hand. On the business side, when I started in the industry, companies were led and organized geographically and functionally. There is a lot more customer focus now, with commercial leadership. We are much more directed by the markets that we serve than by the products that we make.\"While Kohlbrand recalls that there was a high school chemistry teacher and a grade school science teacher whom he admired, he most respects leaders who have made an impact on the world, from, the Mormon Church founder who created a series of influential governing principles, to Benjamin Franklin, who made contributions to printing, science, and government.\"Patton was not a particularly nice guy, but he sure showed the tenacity and the ability during the war to really make a difference,\" says Kohlbrand. \"He was wired for conflict.\"In 2002, Kohlbrand was recognized for his lifetime of career accomplishment with IIT's Professional Achievement Award and in 2009, the Charles W. Pierce Distinguished Alumni Award. In 1997, Kohlbrand added an especially unique credit to his name: he was selected as the Ralph Peck Distinguished Lecturer, in a longtime tradition that honors the former Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering chair and thermodynamics professor whose 10-minute quizzes taught Kohlbrand not only a tough science, but how to incorporate all of the component parts into a most interesting and valuable whole.American Institute of Chemical Engineers:The Dow Chemical Company:Engineers Without Borders:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/sake-land", "content": "When one considers Chicago's rich architectural legacy, iconic buildings first come to mind. But there are other notable projects that instead transform pockets of the urban environment into sanctuaries that provide an escape from the gritty into the sublime. Humboldt Park, the Lincoln Park Lily Pool, and the Chicago Botanic Garden are world-class examples of the field of design known as landscape architecture. Recognizing that space and resource utilization within cities have taken on an increased urgency, IIT College of Architecture developed the Program of Landscape Architecture, the only such professional program in Chicago, which graduated its first class of Master of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.) students in May 2009.\"Essentially, landscape architects are involved in all aspects of land organization, design, and management,\" says Peter Osler, director of the program. Project examples range from residential settings to public plazas to vast territories managed by the federal government.Osler notes that the current 21 full-time and eight part-time master's students in IIT's three-year program hold degrees in fields as diverse as business, environmental studies, fine arts, law, and philosophy. This provides a variety of viewpoints crucial to the interdisciplinary nature of landscape architecture.With today's emphasis on sustainability and \"going green,\" students are entering the profession at an especially fertile time. \"A lot of the students come into the program with an interest in ecological issues. When they become exposed to design and grasp the role of design in improving the environment, many become very excited about the possibility of the project challenges being solved with an artistic hand and mind,\" Osler explains. \"It's not just an ecological system but a complex that needs to be formed, molded, directed, and staged.\"In such projects, a multidisciplinary-team approach is gaining ground, with landscape architects working alongside ecologists, hydrologists, and other scientists to understand various layers of information and to synthesize them in a meaningful way. Developing space for urban agriculture in metropolitan regions like Chicago is another new area of interest for landscape architects, as more emphasis is being placed on local food sources and more innovative, efficient ways to supply communities with fresh produce. An elective course on urban agriculture offered in spring 2009 was so popular that another is being scheduled for 2010.From late August to December 2009, students in a studio course led by Chicago landscape architect Terry Guen utilized the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie as their field classroom. Established in 1996, Midewin is the first national tallgrass prairie in the country and is undergoing a rebirth from its former identity as part of the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. IIT students employed a geographic information system (GIS) as a basis of regional-scale ecological landscape planning and design. A GIS captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and presents data that is linked to a location.Guen explains that \"the ecological, social, and historic components of the site were analyzed based upon GIS files provided to IIT by the U.S. Forest Service and Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie as part of their educational mission. In addition, the students collected data from numerous state and regional agencies, and took multiple trips to the site to correlate their collected information with personal experience.\" At the students' mid-term presentation of their findings to Midewin staff, Guen says, \"The ultimate compliment was paid when the planners requested copies of the students' analyses and suitability studies.\"Following the presentation, students pursued individual projects based upon 14 ecological design principles they developed through their site suitability findings. Rick Short, Midewin's resident landscape architect, is one of the planners who reviewed the students' presentation and is helping to guide the prairie's establishment as part of a long-range plan set in place by the USFS. A landscape architect for the past 23 years, Short believes that the profession is on solid ground.\"The more demands we have on the land, the greater the need for landscape architects,\" he says."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/she-listens-animals", "content": "\"A hug delights and warms and charms; that must be why God gave us arms,\" goes a clever anonymous quotation.What about fins?As a child, Melissa Shyan-Norwalt (M.S. PSYC '81) was approached by stray dogs and scared horses, and believed even then that members of the kingdom Animalia may be more than just creatures of instinct. Now an animal behaviorist, Shyan-Norwalt had a special experience with a bottlenose dolphin later in her life that only strengthened these feelings.While enjoying her morning coffee at the University of Hawaii at M\u00e3noa, Shyan-Norwalt, then a doctoral student in experimental psychology, heard a high-pitched whistle, much like a teakettle spouting off. She realized it was coming from the dolphin pool and recognized it as a distress call: one of the mammals had somehow toppled out of the water and was lying on the concrete perimeter. Except for a few scratches on its back, the female dolphin appeared to be fine and was hoisted back into its water world. Shyan-Norwalt decided to get into the pool to observe the animal more closely, and got a big surprise.\"She swam up me so that her head was leaning on my left shoulder and her body was pressed against mine,\" recalls Shyan-Norwalt. \"I held her and petted her, and she held me with her pectoral fins. I could feel her heart rate start to slow down; she wanted to be comforted. In comparative cognitive psychology, we train animals and ask them to do things so that we can learn how they think and what they can do. But I don't always expect them to have a bond. As people, we develop bonds because we're sentimental. But animals sometimes show you that they have really developed a bond with you.\"Shyan-Norwalt says that while it has been shown scientifically that animals do have \"feelings\"\u2014if defined behaviorally or as physiological responses\u2014misconceptions do occur. It is the job of some applied animal behaviorists to ensure that the social signals between animals and humans are correctly interpreted. (After Shyan-Norwalt's tender moment with the bottlenose, the dolphin reverted back to its species-typical ways by trying to bite her as soon as its confidence returned.)An Animal Behavior Society-certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB), Shyan-Norwalt is one of only 55 individuals worldwide who hold such a credential. To qualify for certification, CAABs must have advanced degrees in a behavioral science or veterinary medicine, provide case studies for review, publish articles in scientific journals, and have years of hands-on supervisory experience with animals.Now a psychology professor at Martin University and founder of Companion Animal Problem Solvers, Inc., a private animal-behavior practice operating in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and Dayton, Ohio, Shyan-Norwalt has vivid memories of pets from an early age. Her parents made sure there was always enough room in her baby carriage to share with \"Junior,\" the family's mixed-breed dog.\"At one point, we had four horses, three dogs, two cats, a parrot, a canary, and a Siamese fighting fish,\" says Shyan-Norwalt, thinking back to her childhood in semi-rural Lloyd Harbor, a suburb of New York. \"By the time I was 12, I knew that I wanted to become a veterinarian.\" She instead combined her interests in human cognition with comparative cognitive work and became what some have endearingly described as a \"pet shrink.\"While most of her current pet clients come from across Ohio and Indiana, Shyan-Norwalt has traveled to zoos and research facilities as a consultant and helped to design a zoo planned for Korea. Invited to speak at veterinary colleges and national animal welfare and shelter conferences, she has been interviewed for local and national TV shows, magazines, and newspapers.Tim Staggs, Shyan-Norwalt's former student at Butler University, assisted her in research on the visual acuity of African elephants, and recalls her as a strong mentor and a visionary.\"She taught me how to learn, plain and simple. Before I began working with her, I was a first-generation college student struggling in school and on academic probation,\" explains Staggs, now a private-practice attorney. \"After meeting her, I graduatedfrom both undergraduate and law schools. She was the first teacher who taught me to work with all that 'potential' others had been talking about my whole life.\"Shyan-Norwalt describes herself as a \"debunker\" who likes to test commonly held assumptions about animals. She is compiling data based on her own observations; for example, do dolphins prefer very large pools? (For at least one zoo group, no.) Are African elephants poor visual users? (Actually, they're pretty good.) Her current research focuses on animal welfare and psychological enrichment for domestic, exotic, and companion animals in zoos and research facilities, trying to determine whether untested assumptions about what is considered enriching for a given species is truly so. She also continues to explore and study new problem-solving strategies for pet behavior issues.\"I'm always looking for ways that animals can 'tell us,' behaviorally, what they can perceive, conceive, comprehend, and problem-solve,\" says Shyan-Norwalt.She offers a number of educational presentations, including one for pet owners and caregivers interested in how to interpret dog and cat facial expressions, body language, and other communication signals. Based on scientific research, the talk exposes the myths and discusses the realities of dominance in the dog, cat, and human species. Shyan-Norwalt says, for example, with almost every mammal a stare is considered a form of challenge, but one with a fairly big twist.\"If it's done within species, it could mean, 'I want to dominate you,' she says. \"If it's across species, it could mean, 'I want to eat you.'\"For several years, Melissa Shyan-Norwalt was a scientist with Iams Company, a manufacturer of premium dog and cat foods, and worked on behavior-modification programs for dogs and cats with adjustment problems. Though she has seen exceptions to the rule, Shyan-Norwalt says that behaviorists use three key principles to positively alter almost any animal's unattractive habits.\"We find a good reinforcer, like food or petting,\" she says, \"then maximize how the animal understands what is being asked of it\u2014what stimuli it is able to recognize and what mediating cues are needed to teach it the task. Finally, we take baby steps. They are needed to break down the desired behaviors into manageable units that can bring the animal to do what we want, whether that is pressing a lever or not attacking another dog on a walk.\"Animal Behavior Society:Companion Animal Problem Solvers, Inc.:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/designer-his-own-destiny", "content": "The military transport ship made a stately entrance into New York Harbor on August 23, 1949, or so it seemed to one young passenger who, along with many other World War II refugees, had traveled more than 4,300 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from Soviet-occupied Lithuania. The ship headed directly to the dock, bypassing Ellis Island by way of a special congressional act. As the young passenger made his way to the exit, the captain plucked him from the crowd, shook his hand, and said, \"Young man, you will have a great future in America.\"The captain could not have known how propitious a statement he had made to the 23-year-old Valdas Adamkus (CE '61, Hon. Ph.D. '99), who would grow up to hold one of this nation's highest-ranking roles in the Environmental Protection Agency and serve two terms (1998\u20132003, 2004\u201309) as president of the homeland he had to leave behind.\"Nobody could predict that all this was going to happen,\" says the 83-year-old Adamkus, recounting his first flush of freedom. \"It probably was my destiny to be given these opportunities.\" While it may indeed have been his destiny to be on that ship, Adamkus had been bound\u2014and determined\u2014to uphold democracy for his entire life.It is now February 16, 2010\u2014coincidentally, the 92nd anniversary of Lithuania's declaration of independence\u2014just over seven months since Adamkus concluded his last term as president. He is staying at the west suburban Chicago townhouse of a friend he is visiting from his days at Lithuania's first high school, the Au\u0161ra Gymnasium, in Kaunas. Adamkus recalls how, 50 years earlier, another Lithuanian family provided shelter after his family immigrated to the United States.\"We lived at 7200 South May Street\u2014I remember the address even today,\" says Adamkus of the home of Kazys Grinius, Lithuania's president in 1926, and whose family immigrated to Chicago in 1947. Grinius signed the affidavit of support that allowed Adamkus, his parents, and his two siblings to come to the United States. \"They had a very small apartment; my mattress was thrown on the floor,\" Adamkus says of the Grinius home. \"That was my first night sleeping in America.\"The son of civil servants, Adamkus was separated from his family during most of his teenage years while he worked as one of three publishers of an underground resistance newspaper. He was able to reunite with his family in 1944 and escape to Germany but returned to Lithuania for a short period to fight the Red Army as part of the National Defence Force. He rejoined his family and lived with them in a displaced persons camp for a total of five years before being given permission to come to the States.Once in Chicago, Adamkus took a job at an automotive parts factory and became active in the city's growing Lithuanian-American community, where he began to establish his reputation as a unifying leader who worked tirelessly to eliminate Soviet control of the Baltic region. He co-founded a federation of young Lithuanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Santara-\u0160viesa, and broadcast his messages through Voice of America. He also organized protests against the occupation in his homeland and was instrumental in gathering 40,000 signatures in a youth petition calling for the federal government to intervene in the ongoing Soviet deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia. The petition was presented to then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon.\"Those who came here but spent their formative years in Lithuania had the motive to fight,\" he explains about the commitment to liberation that fueled and forged together his new community in the United States.After he graduated from IIT (family friend Liutas \"Leo\" Grinius [EE '53] introduced him to the university), Adamkus was working as a draftsman at an engineering firm when then-Illinois senator Everett Dirksen invited him to work on environmental issues for the federal government. The two years Adamkus thought he would stay turned into a 27-year career capped by his appointment as administrator of EPA Region 5, responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution-control efforts in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. He served the EPA under six presidents, from Nixon to Bill Clinton, before he left in 1997 to run for the Lithuanian presidency.One of his proudest moments at the EPA came in 1983 when, under pressure by lobby forces, he refused to alter a report compiled by his team that fingered the pollutant dioxin as a carcinogen and found high levels of the substance in the Great Lakes. The matter received national attention when Adamkus appeared in a congressional hearing on the case, which involved a major chemical company. Adamkus notes that while much work still remains in protecting the environment, during his years with the EPA, Lake Erie was lifted from its \"dead lake\" status, the level of polychlorinated biphenyls in Waukegan Harbor were reduced, and Chicago's air pollution levels dropped. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award of Distinguished Executive for his overall efforts.But an earlier experience at the EPA ultimately shifted the professional course for which he was destined. In 1972, President Nixon sent him to Moscow to attend an environmental conference as part of an official U.S. delegation. Through this event, Adamkus secured a side trip to Lithuania\u2014his first in almost 30 years\u2014and grew more involved in Lithuanian environmental concerns. By the time the Soviet Union's control of Lithuania had weakened and was finally broken in 1990, Adamkus had made several return trips to his homeland, where his name and reputation had became widely known. Several political parties asked him to run as a presidential candidate.After living in the United States for 50 years, Adamkus returned home. During his two terms as president, he achieved one of the highest approval ratings among Lithuanian politicians, and is still recognized as a moral authority.\"He was a great administrator and a very honest man, one whom you trusted,\" says Stanley Balzekas Jr., president of the Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture and longtime Chicago businessman. Balzekas met with Adamkus many times over the years and recalls that the former president always made himself available to everyone. \"He was a man of the world, bringing great stability to Lithuania and the surrounding regions,\" he says. \"He wasn't looking for any personal gain or notoriety.\"By having the opportunity to experience a free society in the United States, Adamkus was able to further unite the people of Lithuania to champion democracy and a better quality of life.\"The principles of freedom and human rights cannot be learned from books; you have to grow up with those ideas so that they become natural and a part of you,\" he explains. \"My two terms as president were based around those principles. I still try to live by them every day.\"Valdas Adamkus presidential biography:Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/image-everything", "content": "If a picture paints a thousand words, a CT scan paints 1 million.In years past, surgeons would commonly conduct exploratory surgery\u2014visually scouting within the patient to diagnose an ailment that a picture, in this case an X-ray, could not detect. While exploratory surgery still has its place in some applications, today complex ailments and the most life-threatening diseases are assessed with the aid of advanced medical imaging. Medical imaging is also used for basic scientific research, and to guide development and testing of new pharmaceuticals.In spite of its high level of sophistication, medical imaging continues to improve at a dramatic pace, and IIT's Medical Imaging Research Center is at the cutting edge of these technological innovations.As Miles Wernick, Motorola Professor and director of MIRC explains, the group focuses on three broad areas of research\u2014creating better images through development of new imaging devices and procedures, improving existing images through new mathematical approaches, and understanding the images that are obtained through the application of advanced computer algorithms. \"Something most people don't appreciate,\" Wernick says, \"is that modern medical images are not like photographs.\" Rather than being captured directly, as images are in a digital camera, medical images (such as MRI) are computed by a complicated mathematical algorithm. \"It's in that computation that the image quality is largely defined,\" he adds.While many research teams specialize in one imaging modality or concentrate on the diagnosis of one type of disease, MIRC is unique in its breadth of areas explored, drawing on $6.3 million in recent research grants, mainly from several different components of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to refining existing imaging methods, MIRC investigators are exploring entirely new methods, such as thermoacoustic imaging, as well as sophisticated search engines and computerized analysis techniques for accessing and making sense of medical images.Although IIT lacks a medical school of its own, MIRC\u2014a branch of IIT's Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering\u2014benefits from close collaborations with the nearby University of Chicago Medical Center and Rush University Medical Center, as well as hospitals and medical schools elsewhere in the United States and in Canada.The following are a few of the promising research areas currently under exploration at MIRC.Yongyi Yang (M.S. AMAT '92, Ph.D. EE '94), professor of electrical and computer engineering, is the principal investigator for an NIH-sponsored project to develop an innovative image-retrieval system\u2014a sort of Google for mammography that conducts searches based on images rather than keywords. Given a patient's mammogram, the software fetches and displays several similar mammograms from a vast library of stored images, providing the radiologist with examples of relevant past cases for comparison. \"It's like a doctor with a really big brain,\" Yang says, referring to the search engine's instant recall from tens of thousands of historical records. Should the search engine pull up images closely resembling those of the mammogram under consideration, it can inform the physician about past patient outcomes and offer useful hunches as to the benign or malignant nature of irregularities appearing in the patient at hand. The system could greatly enhance the usefulness of mammograms, which are notoriously tricky to interpret, and may also limit unnecessary biopsies and missed cancers. The project will be tested using the University of Chicago's Hospital Information System, a database containing a large number of patient records.While brain imaging is typically accomplished by big, expensive machines like CT or MRI scanners, simpler, more portable devices are also being explored. Mark Anastasio (EE '92), associate professor of biomedical engineering, along with colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis, is working on thermoacoustic imaging\u2014a new technique that may be applied clinically within the next few years. The hybrid method combines electromagnetic waves with acoustical properties to deliver 3-D images. A short electromagnetic pulse is used to irradiate biological tissue, which absorbs this pulse, causing emission of acoustic signals that can be measured and used in conjunction with a mathematical algorithm to form a 3-D map of the tissue's properties.One of the significant advantages of thermoacoustic imaging is that it can be achieved using a compact device that can be wheeled into a hospital room, eliminating the need to transport patients to a separate imaging facility. It could also be used in ambulances, on battlefields, or in other remote settings. Further, thermoacoustic imaging provides an attractive alternative to X-ray imaging, replacing harmful ionizing radiation with safe microwave frequencies capable of penetrating the skull. Anastasio is working to perfect the mathematical tools, including image-reconstruction algorithms, needed to produce accurate images from this exotic form of data.While the term gray matter\u2014referring to concentrations of neuronal cell bodies in the brain\u2014is familiar to most, the brain's white matter is equally important. White-matter nerve fibers are highways of the central nervous system that connect different brain regions and are a focus of research for Konstantinos Arfanakis, BME associate professor. He has created an atlas of white-matter nerve fibers based on an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The atlas is now available to the scientific community: to date, more than 30 groups in more than 12 countries around the world are using the IIT atlas.DTI is able to map neural tracts by measuring the amount of diffusion of water molecules within white-matter tissue. Within a healthy nerve fiber, water is mainly able to diffuse along the direction of nerve fiber tracts; therefore, by tracing the direction of highest diffusion, one can make a roadmap of the tracts.When axons have been affected by disease, this diffusion property changes and provides clues to the onset of disease and its nature. Arfanakis is using DTI in a large-scale study of Alzheimer's disease in collaboration with Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago to investigate associated microscopic changes in white-matter tissue.Preliminary findings show that DTI may reveal changes in brain tissue long before a subject is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis of the disease will allow identification of the most appropriate human subjects to participate in tests of new drugs for Alzheimer's patients. Also, early diagnosis of the disease will allow early intervention, which could minimize neuronal damage and associated impairment of mental function. And because conventional DTI techniques yield poor image quality in the brain regions that play a major role in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, Arfanakis is developing new DTI techniques to improve imaging in these regions.Imaging research at IIT's Medical Imaging Research Center touches all areas of the body.MIRC is developing thermoacoustic imaging, a new technique allowing for a highly mobile imaging platform, combining sound and electromagnetic waves to produce a detailed, non-invasive image of the brain.Diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI, has been applied to the detailed study of the brain's white-matter fiber tracts. By examining differences in water diffusion through neural fibers, researchers hope to dramatically improve early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain ailments.Image of the eye taken with a new X-ray setup at IITIdentifying arterial plaques in the carotid artery through phase contrast imaging will help physicians identify plaques and determine which ones are in danger of rupturing.Microcalcifications in breast tissue and other abnormalities suggestive of disease are being examined through MIRC's innovative image retrieval system\u2014a kind of search engine that combs historical patient records, providing physicians with a wealth of diagnostically relevant information.Phase contrast imaging and multiple-image radiography, two advanced forms of X-ray imaging, are being refined to provide more detailed and useful mammography images.MIRC is developing new 4-D and 5-D approaches to imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) that use advanced image-processing methods to permit new ways of imaging patients with heart disease.MIRC is also developing image analysis methods based on CT scans, which identify vulnerable plaques in coronary arteries.MIRC investigators are developing techniques of multiple image radiography using three combined images displaying the effects of absorption, refraction, and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering, providing unprecedented image quality.No standard method for imaging prostate cancer currently exists, and existing diagnostic methods are often difficult to interpret. MIRC researchers are exploring the use of multiparametric MRI, hoping to improve algorithms for cancer detection by non-invasive means.Phase contrast X-ray imaging is an area in which IIT has high visibility, led by Anastasio, Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Jovan Brankov (M.S. EE '99, Ph.D. '02), and Wernick, under three NIH research grants: two studying mammography and one studying arterial plaques.Whereas conventional imaging considers X-rays to behave like rays penetrating the body and forming a shadow on an imaging camera, phase contrast imaging views X-rays as waves, like ordinary visible light. \"We're treating the X-ray system as an optical system,\" Anastasio notes. By using wave properties of X-rays, phase contrast techniques, such as the multiple-image radiography (MIR) technique developed at IIT, are able to show cancer and other abnormalities of soft tissue with extraordinary clarity. Furthermore, the MIR technique has technical advantages that may allow mammography to be performed without painful compression of the breast, and with a greatly reduced radiation dose.The true measure of a successful imaging technique is whether it enhances doctors' decision-making abilities. When doctors correctly diagnose cancer by using a new type of imaging, the imaging technique is deemed a success. But this raises the question: how can you test the diagnostic performance of doctors? An obvious way is to show doctors hundreds of images, some with cancer and some without, and see whether their diagnoses are correct. Unfortunately, this approach is not very practical, particularly if there is a need to compare many different imaging methods, requiring doctors to examine thousands of images. Under $2.5 million in grants from the NIH, Brankov is developing a software suite that makes these determinations automatically. The software \"learns\" to predict physicians' diagnostic performance based on new kinds of medical images from prior data on their performance in similar prior examples. A portion of Brankov's work is already in use at Siemens Medical Systems.An estimated 200,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer next year, yet there is not an agreed-upon method of imaging for this prevalent disease. Lacking an authoritative imaging tool, doctors must perform uncomfortable biopsy procedures to diagnose the disease. Samil Yetik, ECE assistant professor, is working with the University Health Network, a large health care provider in Canada, to demonstrate a new approach to diagnosing prostate cancer. In this method, several kinds of MRI images are taken during one session, and these are combined using pattern recognition algorithms to produce pictures showing areas of the prostate affected by cancer. This method has provided greater than 95 percent accuracy in preliminary studies, and they are planning a larger clinical study to verify these promising findings.Data mining\u2014a strategy for examining large volumes of information in an effort to identify underlying patterns\u2014is at the heart of a collaboration between IIT, the Chicago Police Department, and software giant Oracle. Using the analytical techniques MIRC researchers have applied to understand medical images, Wernick and colleagues are trolling the police department's vast repository of information\u2014one of the largest databases of any kind in the country. Their goal is to extract from the wealth of existing police data the patterns of activity that will help the police predict future crime. Using such variables as weather forecasts, recent crime incidents, gang activity, concerns raised at town hall meetings, 911 calls, and thousands of other variables, they will produce maps of projected crime patterns resembling those seen in brain imaging, in which hot spots of activity are highlighted. The project is supported in part through a grant from the National Institute of Justice.The earliest type of medical imaging\u2014Roentgen's X-ray\u2014formed a shadow picture of the patient's body onto a photographic plate. The X-ray is still widely used, for example, in mammography. However, X-rays are difficult to interpret because the information is mixed together: an abnormality on the skin cannot be distinguished from one deep within the patient. Therefore, most modern methods of medical imaging employ a different approach called tomography, which produces images that appear as virtual slices of the patient's body. By viewing these slices, the physician can precisely locate and characterize abnormalities in relation to normal structures. Tomography has led to an ever-expanding alphabet soup of imaging methods\u2014including CT, MRI, PET, SPECT\u2014each of which portrays a different property of the body's structure or function. For example, a PET scan shows how rapidly the body is consuming glucose (sugar); thus, PET scans can show the location of tumors, or regions of the brain that become active during specific activities. MRI is like a Swiss Army knife: by changing its computer programming, MRI images can measure many different properties of the body, including blood oxygenation effects that reveal the workings of the brain.National Cancer Institute site on cancer imaging:IIT Medical Imaging Research Center:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2009/i-knew-i-wanted-be-university-president", "content": "If not for the influence of an extraordinary educator, IIT alumnus and trustee(PHYS '63) might never have embarked on the path that led him to an outstanding career in academia, culminating in the presidency of Purdue University.As a specialist in fluid dynamics with extensive knowledge in heat transfer, fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, and other technical areas critical to aircraft and spacecraft design, the doors to high-paying research jobs at private aerospace companies would have been flung wide open for him.Instead, he met Judson Baron, a decorated World War II veteran who was a professor and researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Jischke was pursuing his master's degree.\"The single biggest factor in my decision [to enter academia] was this remarkable teacher,\" Jischke recalls. \"On my first day on campus, I went to his office because he was my graduate advisor. He signed me up for classes, including one of his on high-speed gas dynamics. He was a fabulous teacher and role model, and was quite an intellectual. After a few months, I decided to write my master's thesis under him and then stayed to get my Ph.D.\"When Jischke earned his doctorate in 1968, he had opportunities to join Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. He decided to try teaching instead.\"First, I thought that being a professor, teaching students and doing research, was a noble enterprise and a way of contributing to society,\" he explains. \"Second, I enjoyed the freedom to pursue research interests in quite a few areas. Third, I thought it would be easier to go from a low-paying job to a high-paying job if I didn't like being a professor. It turned out to be a great decision.\"Jischke graduated from Proviso High School (now) in near west suburban Chicago and became the first member of his family to attend college when he entered IIT in 1959. In route to earning his degree in physics, Jischke was something of a big man on campus. He was president of his class, ran the Union Board, worked as a radio announcer at sporting events, and even organized IIT's first homecoming event. His affection for the university would lead Jischke to return as a trustee more than 40 years after graduating.\"The fact that I've been the president of four institutions gives me a background of knowledge and experience that is helpful to the rest of the board,\" he says. \"I hope I can help the board better understand the issues facing IIT and how we might address them.\"(LAW '65), a graduate of IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law and himself a former interim president of Indiana University, believes Jischke would be an asset on any board.\"If you put him into almost any leadership role, he would figure out how to lead the people and the organization,\" Bepko says. \"He'd introduce the right values; help develop the mission, vision, goals, and objectives; and then execute on them. He's a very formidable leader.\"After leaving MIT, Jischke spent six years teaching at the University of Oklahoma and becoming a tenured professor. In 1974, he was eligible for a sabbatical, where he could either attend Harvard University, Oxford University, or Imperial College, or accept a White House fellowship. He chose the latter, working for a year as a special assistant to William T. Coleman, the secretary of transportation.The White House experience was a critical juncture in his evolution. \"I learned a lot about myself and government and what I might do with my life,\" Jischke says. \"I spent a lot of time thinking about the next 30 years or so. I decided after that to get on the track to more leadership and administrative roles. I knew I wanted to be a university president.\"He returned to Oklahoma, where he became a department head and began the arduous task of schooling himself in areas critical to being an effective university president. He studied public speaking and fundraising. He read heavily about the broader issues affecting higher education and scanned the Harvard annual report. He followed the writings and careers of several presidents, including those at Oklahoma, the University of Michigan, and Princeton University.\"They had a broader view of the role of higher education in the world,\" Jischke explains. \"It wasn't narrowly the teaching of young people and doing research. They saw higher education as tools by which better societies were developed.\"Other common traits were the ability to communicate clearly and passionately, whether through public speaking or position papers, and an understanding of finances and fundraising. \"Financial resources are inevitably a factor in achieving the broader mission,\" he explains. \"When it's all said and done, the best universities tend to be the best-financed universities.\"After a total of 17 years at Oklahoma\u2014including five years as dean of the College of Engineering\u2014he became the university's interim president in 1985. In 1986, he was named chancellor of the University of Missouri\u2013Rolla, and in 1991 became president of Iowa State University.At both schools, Jischke beefed up scholarship programs and set new records for fundraising.His successes at those colleges led to his high-profile presidency at Purdue. Arriving in 2000 as the school's 10th president, he set an ambitious agenda from the start, aiming to transform Purdue from a great university into a preeminent university while strengthening its ties to the larger economy in Indiana.Jischke launched a five-year plan including a capital campaign that raised more than $1.7-billion and more than 50 capital projects. The centerpiece of the building initiative was, a $400 million interdisciplinary hub focusing on everything from biosciences to manufacturing to health-care engineering. He also added 300 new faculty members with a strong emphasis on science and engineering.A passionate advocate for attracting more American students to engineering, he was chosen by President George W. Bush for a seat on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in February 2006.\"Science and technology affect our country in so many ways, from its economic competitiveness to national security to the strength of its educational systems,\" Jischke says. \"It's a very, very important area for national policy and national investments.\"The council has devoted much of its time toward energy issues including the need to transition away from traditional fossil fuels, he explains.It also has studied the American research and development system, and science and technology issues affecting personalized medicine.\"These are all issues of great importance to the country,\" he adds. \"It's been a great honor to work with these very distinguished Americans to provide the president with carefully considered advice.\"Jischke backed his passion for science with initiatives that put a Purdue education within reach for more talented students. He led an effort to create a new program to offer need-based scholarships to Purdue in each of Indiana's 92 counties and launched an effort to provide eligible graduates of the Indianapolis school system with four-year scholarships if they pursued a science-related major.\"Top-notch research facilities attract good faculty. Faculty, in turn, attract good students,\" says J. Timothy McGinley, chair of the Purdue Board of Trustees, who notes the university recently named a biomedical engineering building for Jischke. \"Martin was very successful at raising so much money, but it was all raised in service of a strategic plan on where to invest. A good part of the funds have gone into scholarships.\"At IIT, Jischke chairs the board's Academic Committee. Friends and colleagues say he brings more than an educator's background to the board.\"Martin understands we have a crisis in this country getting men and women into engineering,\" says Peter Magrath, president of West Virginia University. \"He knows we must get students energized and excited about math and science. They must be inspired, so they go to a great engineering college like IIT.\"Since leaving Purdue, Jischke has barely slowed down. In addition to the IIT board, he serves on the board of, a manufacturing firm in Lafayette, Ind.;, a real-estate investment trust based in Indianapolis; and, a utility firm based in Evansville, Ind.Additionally, he's involved in charitable work and has been consulting on higher-education issues in Ireland, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan.\"Education is as important and powerful a tool for societal progress as it has ever been,\" Jischke says. \"Our ability to solve problems, to create opportunities, and to understand the world around us all hinge on education.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2010/golden-photo-opportunity", "content": "Not many photo subjects look their most flattering while wearing the shade of vermilion known as International Orange. A nearly 9,000-foot-long exception is one of the world's most monumental man-made marvels, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.Robert E. David (M.S. DSGN '73) can not only name the pair who figured prominently in the decision to paint the bridge in that vibrant hue (husband-and-wife architects Irving and Gertrude Morrow), but for more than 36 years\u2014and counting\u2014has captured the color in some 20,000 photographs covering more than 1,000 assignments. It's all part of the life of being the official photographer of the.David's enviable vocation came to him as a complete surprise. With a bachelor's degree in architecture and an interest in industrial design, David decided to pursue a master's in product design at IIT Institute of Design, where he began to develop skills in photography as well as in the then new field of computer-aided design. After several years teaching a course he developed on computer applications in architecture and industrial design at the Kansas City Art Institute and the University of Kansas, David enrolled in the architecture doctoral program at the University of California Berkeley. He gave a copy of his term paper on the analysis of traffic patterns in the area of the Golden Gate Bridge to the district agency and was subsequently offered a position with the agency that combined work in graphics, architecture, and photography. David was ultimately given the position of design director.\"While I was working there for so many years, I found that the design services my staff and I offered at one time or another had applications to just about every department and person within the 1,000-member organization,\" says David, noting that he is one of the employees with the longest tenure. \"Evolving along with all of that was a lot of photography of various objects for historical purposes.\" David has also photographed the transit buses and ferries that comprise the district.While David's most famous subject, the Golden Gate Bridge, continues to be the primary focus of his photography, he says he is never bored, as his bridge assignments have ranged from the picturesque to the informative. David estimates that 50 or 60 of his bridge photographs are scattered throughout Washington, D.C., and laughingly recalls seeing one hanging on the wall through an open office door during a CNN televised broadcast from the United States Capitol. Retired from his full-time duties in 2003, David now works part-time photo-documenting the bridge's $400 million. Begun in mid-1990s, the project is estimated to be complete by 2015.Constructed in 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge is recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven civil engineering wonders of the United States. The 7.1-magnitudeof 1987, however, with its epicenter some 60 miles south of the bridge, caused the State of California to formulate new structural guidelines for all bridges within the state. In response to these guidelines, the retrofit project was begun.A San Francisco native who lives in the house where he grew up within sight of the Golden Gate Bridge, David recalls that his strong and early interest in the bridge was rewarded with a special gift. After David toured the bridge in 1955 as a Cub Scout, his friend's father presented him with a bound copy of the chief engineer's report, originally issued in 1937.\"It had fold-out drawings of various aspects of the structure and as a drawing exercise, I would copy them manually,\" David explains. \"This book was my first memory of the bridge.\" Coincidentally, as part of his job, David republished the text for the 50th anniversary of the bridge in 1987, retrieving some 200 original negatives and producing high-quality digital images for the new book.To add to the rich historical legacy of the bridge that he has helped to further establish, David is hoping to participate in the development of a Golden Gate Bridge museum. To increase his knowledge of museum issues, he has been active in seminars and conferences within the national museum community. It is a way to build his own bridge connecting the Golden Gate Bridge's storied past to present and future generations."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2009/john-d-root-humanist-and-historian", "content": "IIT Archives is processing the papers of John D. Root (1940\u20132004), a professor of history who spent his entire academic career at IIT (1969\u20132001). This collection\u2014which includes many photocopies of documents and publications on English Catholic Modernism that can be found in original form only in European archives\u2014will be made available to the public in early 2009.It's perhaps not surprising that a humanities professor would posit that \"every military man should be a humanist.\" For John Root these words were more than a philosophical statement and borne of experience as a platoon leader in the Vietnam War. He lived and taught as a humanist, advocating for all IIT faculty and students, and lending his voice to campus issues that he viewed as a challenge to the integrity of the university.Root received his B.A. from thein 1962 and his M.A. fromin 1964. From 1966\u201368 he served with the United States Army in Vietnam, attaining the rank of captain and receiving two Bronze Star Medals. Root's strong interest in modern history was given sharper focus by his wartime experiences.In 1969, Root became an instructor of history at IIT and worked his way up to full professor in 1987. He was chair of the IIT Department of Humanities from 1983\u20131998, fighting for the retention of humanities programs and staffing in an era of cost cutting at a technology-focused university that would naturally seek to protect its basic posture in the sciences above all else. Yet, Root succeeded in saving the humanities agenda.His academic specialty was Roman Catholic Modernism in the period 1885\u20131925, and on its face one would be hard-pressed to find a subject more removed from the IIT curriculum. Root spoke to IIT audiences that were appreciative of his insights into the relationship between scientific and religious/spiritual truths. Although he suffered from multiple sclerosis, which prematurely aged and physically limited him in a university context\u2014where being, or at least acting, young is almost a core requirement\u2014his own physical disability made him a strong and convincing advocate for improved physical access at IIT for all who work and study at the university.Finally, Root's service in Vietnam engaged his already sensitive and observant qualities and created a strong scholar of the American experience. Student-authored evaluation forms in the Root Papers testify to the powerful messages that Root delivered in his classes on the Vietnam War about the roles of power, history, culture, and personal responsibility in the implementation of policy. His publications included dozens of articles, book reviews, and conference papers.Root was also deeply involved in university affairs beyond the humanities department. He was an officer of the Faculty Council, a pre-law advisor, and served on numerous university committees. He headed the committee that guided the creation of Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985. Root retained an office at IIT following retirement in 2001, and not long after his sudden death in 2004, his papers were transferred directly from his office to the IIT Archives, without being culled either by himself or any family members.Root's papers provide a comprehensive overview of his entire career and demonstrate his care in documenting his various activities and communications, both within the IIT community and outside (with fellow scholars, particularly in the field of Catholic Modernism studies). The collection will serve as an important primary source for research into IIT's academic and administrative culture in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as for English Catholic Modernism.A good example of Root's activism, observant nature, and history acumen is found in a file among his papers titled \"Library Fiasco.\" Inside is a neatly typed, single-spaced, three-page \"Chronology of the Library Canopy Saga, May\u2013September 1985,\" in which he recounts the literal rise and fall of a post-Modernist canopy that was briefly installed above the entrance of Galvin Library in September 1985; it was removed within 48 hours after it went up, following protests that the canopy was incompatible with the strictly modern lines and angles of the Walter Netsch-designed building (1962). At that time, IIT had decided to sever its agreement with the John Crerar Library, which was a private library housed in what is now Galvin Library. Root's committee was charged with negotiating the termination of Crerar's tenancy and also discussing \"the possibility of structural modifications to allow entrance directly to the main floor of the library\" (Root Papers). This idea was dismissed as being unworkable and too expensive.By the beginning of 1985, Root had learned from campus authorities that the entrance to the library would remain on the ground floor but that a canopy would be erected over it. Under the date \"17 May (Friday),\" Root wrote, \"By chance, I saw drawings in office of David Dowell [library director]. Upset that I and the Planning Committee had no previous knowledge. David told me that the final plan would be complete and contracts let by the following Tuesday. He told me that no one from Crown Hall [IIT College of Architecture] was involved.\"Root immediately saw the possible political and aesthetic dangers in modifying one of the university's key Modernist buildings without involving the various stakeholders. \"I also expressed amazement that the firm that had actually built the library (I believe Skidmore) had not been consulted,\" he wrote.\"30 May. I wrote to President Martin about the above, emphasizing that it was imperative to solicit Crown Hall advice since a Miesian building was about to be altered.\" Root then writes that he was unable to remain in close touch with the key players in the unfolding drama as he and they had \"conflicting travel schedules\" over the summer months. \"The library was out of my mind until 29 August, when Martin asked me to speak at the September 13th dedication.\"\"3 September (Tuesday). The day after Labor Day, the steelworkers began installing the canopy, and everyone on campus was shocked to see the very un-Miesian yellow, blue, and white beams, suspended by red cable\u2026. That afternoon, Martin holds a meeting of his administrative staff, all of whom express general opposition to the canopy.\"A decision to remove the canopy was taken on September 6, Root recorded, and on September 10 it was \"removed by nightfall.\" \"11 September (Wednesday): Tribune front page story with color photo. Also in N.Y. Times with photo. Other reporters flock to campus; all disappointed that the canopy was gone. I was interviewed by the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.\"Coda. In all this, my heart went out to the Galvin family. We all played it as straight as possible. As the canopy was coming down, the last pain [sic] was being applied to the interior. Black paint was applied to marred outside steel surfaces and the last letter of Paul V. Galvin's name was place over the entrance at 4:15 p.m. on September 13th. At 5:00 p.m. the open house and touring of the 'new' library began. The black-tied and gowned guests sipped cocktails in the Faculty Club at 6:00 p.m., and the formal dinner in the ballroom began at 7:00 p.m. It was a splendid event, classy and carried off with class.

Coordinated by Dartmouth College Thayer School of Engineering, the competition is sponsored by the SAE and the.Each year, more than 100 students from various academic disciplines participate in IIT's Formula Hybrid team to design and build an open-wheel, single-seat plug-in hybrid racecar that both excels in the competition's three events\u2014acceleration, autocross, and endurance\u2014and feasibly serves as a manufacturing prototype. While the car must conform to a formula that specifies, for example, the materials that can be used for the frame or the maximum length of the wheelbase, and that emphasizes drive train innovation and fuel efficiency, creativity is strongly encouraged.IIT students incorporated several new features in Hammer Hawk, the team's latest vehicle. Among them are a parallel arrangement of lithium-iron phosphate batteries and ultracapacitor packs (devices that store and release energy very rapidly), four-wheel regenerative braking, and a student-designed and fabricated planetary gearbox. A six-speed pneumatically-actuated and computer-controlled transmission that reduces motor speed while increasing torque output at the wheels, the gearbox drives the wheels at the proper speed and allows for greater acceleration\u2014to the tune of 0 to 60 miles per hour in just under four seconds, according to Sibley. \"That's faster than a lot of Porsches,\" he says.While IIT team members are relatively new to the racing scene as compared to students at schools with decades of Formula SAE experience, Sibley notes that the learning opportunity is invaluable, especially working with a mentor who is considered a leading expert in electric-drive and hybrid-electric vehicles.\"Where we may lack in mechanical and fabrication experience, we really make up for it by having access to front-running technology and ideas through Dr. Emadi,\" he says of his professor, who was recently honored byfor helping to make Chicago a center for hybrid technology research, development, and application.\"I've never been on a team that works together better than this one, that has more committed people,\" says Sibley. \"It has become a passion for many of us.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2009/walter-nathan-preserving-past", "content": "History holds many dark secrets, but sooner or later, truth finds a way to shine through. One such lucid moment revealed itself to Walter Nathan (ME '44) on a transatlantic flight in early 2006. Nathan, a member of IIT's Board of Trustees, was reading an article in theabout how Germany's Dresdner Bank was instrumental in the Aryanization of Jewish-owned enterprises in the 1930s. By 1938, the Nazis, in their radical idea to bring about a non-Jewish Caucasian or Aryan so-called master race, had prohibited Jews from operating trades and businesses, and from offering goods and services in Nazi Germany. Initially, the Nazis allowed the businesses to be sold to non-Jewish owners, with valuable assets being sold far below market value.Founder and chair of RTC Industries, Inc., a Rolling Meadows, Ill.-based company that provides a wide range of business services to brand and retail clients the world over, Nathan was initially dumbstruck by the words in front of him and became overwhelmed by memories that conjured a looming possibility.\"When I read the article and all of the details, I said to myself, 'That's what happened to my father,' says Nathan, whose love of family runs deep. \"Even though I was a little boy at the time, and parents did not tell kids too much about their business, I had heard bits and pieces of the occurrences.\"Not able to get thearticle out of his mind, Nathan contacted the reporter to learn more about what he felt certain was a link to his family's past. The reporter put him in touch with the two academicians interviewed for the article, one of whom confirmed what Nathan had suspected: the Ada-Ada Shoe Company, founded by his father, Richard, and one of the largest shoe manufacturers in Germany, had fallen victim to Aryanization. He also told Nathan that he had written about this case in a book commissioned by the Dresdner Bank.With that discovery, Nathan arranged to meet the researcher in Berlin, taking with him his youngest daughter, Betsy; her husband, Daniel; his oldest grandson, Ben; and one cousin. Nathan was invited to visit the archives of the Dresdner Bank, where he obtained the complete details of the business transaction between his father and the Nazis. Before the group returned home, Nathan took his family to the fifteenth-century Jewish cemetery in the town of Gau-Algesheim, his father's birthplace, which he had last visited with his father 70 years earlier.During that 1936 visit to the cemetery, Nathan took along his new 35mm camera, a recent bar mitzvah gift. He took photos of the many Nathan family headstones found throughout the cemetery, which held nearly 150 graves of Jews from Gau-Algesheim and the neighboring town, Ockenheim. Less than one year later, with the persecution of German Jews rampant and the Holocaust imminent, Nathan and his family fled the country to settle in Chicago.Nathan recalls the sweltering day in summer 2006 when he returned to the burial grounds. His grandson and cousin, who accompanied him, helped the 83-year-old patriarch climb over the low wall that ringed the small cemetery. Inside, the devastation took his breath away. Only a few Nathan family headstones remained, propped up against the wall.\"I immediately remembered that I had photographs of the graves that I took when I was 13 years old, and assumed that I saved them,\" says Nathan.The group spent the next couple of hours contemplating the damage and trying to decipher the Hebrew inscriptions on each headstone. Returning to the town, Nathan saw three men approximately his age seated at a table in the local caf\u00e9. On a hunch, he approached the trio, telling them that his father was born in the town and asking if any of them could share information about the cemetery. One of the men put him in contact with Alois Ebert, the town's historical records keeper, who gave Nathan the booklet, which provided extensive information on Nathan's ancestors.Nathan and the booklet's author, Ludwig Hellriegel, a retired Catholic priest who served in Gau-Algesheim for 30 years, met during the autumn of 2006. Hellriegel shared with Nathan his grief over the murderous treatment of the Jews by the Nazis. After their conversation, there arose in Nathan a conviction that justice must be served. The only way this could be done, he felt, was to punish those who were responsible for the desecration of the cemetery. Nathan was so convinced that this was the correct approach that he sought the help of the Honorable Dieter Faust, mayor of Gau-Algesheim.\"I told the mayor that I would like to find the perpetrators who did this. He just kind of looked at me,\" says Nathan, thinking back to that day with a wry smile. \"I guess he thought that I was crazy.\"The mayor instead helped Nathan realize that too many years had passed between the vandalism at the cemetery and today. As his anger began to ebb, Nathan focused on his living family and came up with a new idea: a memorial that would pay tribute to all who were buried there\u2014a reminder to visitors that hope prevails despite the sometimes heinous conduct of humankind. The mayor offered to contribute and gave his approval for a monument to be erected at the cemetery. He suggested that Nathan choose November 9 as the day for the unveiling ceremony.\"The ninth of November is now a memorial day in Germany because during that night in 1938, the Nazis stormed into Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues all over Germany, and ransacked and burned them,\" explains Nathan, a benefactor of IIT's Voices of the Holocaust archival project, which opened in April at the. \"That marked the beginning of the physical persecution of the Jews. Many were sent to concentration camps that night, never to be seen again.\"Known as, \"the night of broken glass,\" by some and Pogrom Night by others (to denote organized violence against a minority group, particularly Jews), the event signaled the early stages of the Holocaust. It is estimated that during Kristallnacht nearly 30,000 men were sent to the camps, and many were murdered. More than 200 synagogues were burned, along with thousands of homes and businesses. Physical evidence from that night was rare until last year, when an Israeli researcher found mounds of looted possessions in a refuse dump in Klandorf, Germany.Once a date for the unveiling ceremony had been selected, Nathan sent a letter to his immediate family of three daughters and a son, inviting them and their spouses, children, and grandchildren to Germany for the memorial service. Some weeks later, Nathan began receiving emails and phone calls from Nathans around the world, telling him they had heard about the event. All told, 55 relatives, many of whom had never met previously, gathered for a Nathan Family Reunion Party at the Dorint Hotel in Wiesbaden the night before the memorial dedication service.On November 9, 2008, the extended family took a chartered bus for the 20-minute ride to the cemetery, where other honored guests and nearly 150 townspeople joined them. After a local horn trio played a traditional Israeli song, the monument was unveiled\u2014a bronze plaque affixed to a single, five-foot-tall stone cut from the local quarry. Adorned simply with the Star of David, the plaque tells the story of the Jews buried there whose graves were defiled, both during the Nazi regime and again sometime after. It also recognizes those never laid to rest in graves\u2014the legions of Jewish citizens murdered in the Shoah, or Holocaust. During the ceremony, the names of the Gau-Algesheim and Ockenheim residents known to have been killed in the Holocaust were recited. Also unveiled were three panels fastened to the wall next to the cemetery gate and which tell the names of the Gau-Algesheim and Ockenheim victims of the Holocaust, and the history of the Jewish families buried there.For Nathan, the ceremony was also a way for his grandchildren to know why they were born in the United States and not in the land of their ancestors.\"I want them to understand what happened. Many in my family are kids who just finished high school,\" explains Nathan. \"To them, what happened 70 years ago is ancient history as the Civil War was to me. But it is really recent history. We have to know it, we have to understand it, and we must remember it. Otherwise, it will happen again.\"Aryanization:\"Refuse Heap Is Archive for Night of Hatred\":\"Profits and Persecution: German Big Business and the Holocaust\":Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2009/ultimate-go-people", "content": "If it's true that behind every good man there is a good woman, then it's worth considering a parallel inspiration, that behind many a good woman-to-woman friendship there exists a good man-to-man friendship\u2014even a 47-year-long one. Consider the case of Ed and Vic, and Carol and Faye.Victor Morgenstern (CHE '64) was already a brother in IIT'sfraternity when Edward Kaplan (ME '65) pledged. \"Ed was a scholar and I was a joint major engaged in plenty of extracurricular activities,\" says Morgenstern, laughing about himself and his friend, two opposites who decided to become roommates during their junior year. \"I remember choosing Ed as the one I wanted to room with for a few reasons,\" he explains. \"Number one, he didn't snore at the time. Number two, he left on the weekends, because he was from Chicago. And number three, he occasionally asked me to come over for dinner.\"Morgenstern, who came to IIT from Long Island, N.Y., didn't own a car, so he and a date tagged along with an older, wheels-privileged fraternity brother (Michael Wolf, IE '62) for a night on the town with his date, Faye Katz. Shortly afterward, Morgenstern found himself asking the permission of his fraternity brother to instead date Katz.Coincidentally, Katz, and Morgenstern's IIT roommate, Ed Kaplan, were already acquainted with each another as they attended Senn High School together along with a classmate by the name of Carol Kozin. \"Since Carol was best of friends with Faye,\" says Kaplan, \"it didn't take too long before the four of us were spending time together.\" As the two men continued to develop their newly formed friendship\u2014with Katz and Morgenstern becoming closer and Kozin and Kaplan becoming closer\u2014the two couples also discovered the beginnings of a natural and shared camaraderie.Ed Kaplan and Carol Kozin married in January 1965; Vic Morgenstern and Faye Katz followed six months later, tying the knot on July 4. After attending Roosevelt University together and getting married, the two women continued to maintain a long-distance, telephone friendship, with the Kaplans residing in Illinois and the Morgensterns moving to Washington, D.C., where Vic attended law school at American University and worked initially for theand then for a legal firm. He knew by his junior year at IIT that his interests were diverging from chemical engineering to law.\"It was interesting in our fraternity that we had a lot of brothers who received engineering or science degrees and either went on to law school or to medical school,\" notes Morgenstern of the competitive house that had the distinction of attaining the top GPA of all the fraternities on campus. \"I started to develop my other interests and they happened to be in student government, the tennis team, and fraternity functions.\"\"As I look back at the students in their group,\" says his wife, \"each and every one has gone on to do well. They benefited so tremendously from the type of education they got at IIT. Victor went on in a totally different direction, but his education really taught him how to think and how to attack problems.\"\"I would say that probably the biggest reason for us staying together was because of Faye and Carol.\"The senior partner of the law firm where Morgenstern was working encouraged him to take an interest in stock market investing; this led Morgenstern to a stock broker who introduced him to the then esoteric strategy of risk arbitrage investing. The broker sought Morgenstern's advice on the legal implications of company mergers and influenced him to begin investing his own money. Eventually, the broker asked Morgenstern to join him in managing accounts. Thus began Morgenstern's entry into the financial field, one that he ultimately made into a highly successful career.After managing money for a variety of clients in Washington, D.C., Morgenstern headed back to the Chicago area, spurred on by an offer to help Irving Harris, the cousin of one of his clients, conduct his family's investment business. The decision to return to the Midwest was not difficult. After all, Morgenstern's in-laws still lived on Chicago's North Side and the Kaplans lived in Northbrook, where Ed was busy creating his own success story.\"Vic was very, very active on campus. I had some positions within the fraternity, but I didn't have any campus positions,\" explains Kaplan, recalling how the traits and interests the roommates discovered and developed at IIT helped to guide them to their respective professions. \"I studied hard at IIT; I wanted to do well. I was very intrigued with science and math.\" His diligent studying earned him membership in theengineering honor society and the Pi Tau Sigma international mechanical engineering honor society. He also received several National Science Foundation grants for his undergraduate research.Kaplan expected to pursue a graduate degree in servo-systems; however, at the last minute, he changed direction. He stayed in Chicago and went to work for the Seeburg Corporation. Shortly thereafter, he was awarded a three-year National Defense Education Act Fellowship to pursue a doctorate in business at Northwestern University. Once in the program, Kaplan decided he didn't want to teach or hold a staff position in industry and instead went on for an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, while working at the Teletype Corporation.He and Gerhard Cless, a Teletype colleague, shared ideas for their own company and left their positions to start what became known as Zebra Technologies, a manufacturer of on-demand labeling and ticketing systems, including thermal bar code label printers and supplies. As of December 2007, Zebra had sold more than 6 million printers to users in 100 countries and had net sales of a record $868.3 million. In addition to being a Zebra cofounder, Kaplan served as the company's chair and CEO for 37 years before retiring in September 2007.Morgenstern continued to develop his financial acumen as a founding principal of the Chicago-based investment advisory firm Harris Associates, which he joined in 1969, the same year that Zebra Technologies' predecessor company,., was incorporated. Morgenstern served as president and CEO of Harris from 1991\u20132000 and chairman from 1995 until his retirement from Harris in 2000. He also was president offrom its inception in 1991 until 2000 and chairman of its board of trustees until his retirement in 2003, at which time he went on to his current position as chair of, a private equity firm running two funds in Chicago.Over the nearly 25 years between Kaplan's and Morgenstern's graduation from IIT and the establishment of their careers, their wives kept in touch even though their husbands were oftentimes too busy to do the same. \"I would say that probably the biggest reason for us staying together was because of Faye and Carol,\" says Kaplan.\"Carol and I just had that special, special relationship,\" explains Faye Morgenstern. \"It was a serendipitous friendship with the added coincidence that the significant men in our lives were fraternity brothers.\" As their children grew up and their professional lives became more settled, the two men embarked on a new phase of their friendship, one that began with Kaplan's invitation to Morgenstern to join the IIT Board of Trustees.\"It was Ed's suggestion to get me more involved with IIT that gave us more opportunities to interact,\" says Morgenstern, who became a trustee in 1994 and also serves on the IIT Institute of Design Board of Overseers. In 2008, they both made the decision to expand their roles on the IIT board and become vice chairs and life trustees. The Morgensterns' two architect daughters, Jennifer Morgenstern and Robyn Morgenstern Rosenblatt, are members of the IIT College of Architecture Board of Overseers; their son, Judd, is an IIT Institute of Design/IIT Stuart School of Business student. The Kaplans' son Martin is CEO of Mesirow Advanced Strategies, Inc., and son Alan is president of.With their children now making their mark in the world, Ed and Vic and Carol and Faye have more opportunities to get together socially. The four even went on a two-week trip to Spain. \"From a friendship point of view, Faye and Vic have been great friends,\" says Kaplan. \"We care about each other's families and what they're doing. We have a very special relationship. I don't think either Vic or I knew where this was going at all at the time that we met, but it turns out today that we really have a lot of common interests and that we cross in many, many different ways. And from a professional point of view, I think he's a superstar.\"Morgenstern agrees with his friend that in spite of their differences, the start of something both endearing and enduring was forged during their days at Alpha Epsilon Pi. \"Because we went back so long where both of us really had no idea what we wanted or where we were going to go, it's always been a very relaxed relationship,\" he says. \"I can be who I am and he could be who his is. We don't have to worry about anything else because we've known each other before we had our successes, during, and after.\"Faye Morgenstern, perhaps, pays two of her oldest and most treasured friends the highest regard of all. \"Carol and Ed are the ultimate go-to people in my life,\" she says. \"I would go to either one\u2014for anything\u2014on any level.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2009/engineering-useful-sulfur-eating-bacterium", "content": "It seems fitting that a small plaque displaying Chicago architect Daniel Burnham's quote \"Make no small plans; they have no magic to stir one's blood\" secured a spot atop the crowded desk of, associate chair and professor of biology at IIT College of Science and Letters. Stark and his team of collaborators and student researchers are involved in a big undertaking with an equally big corporation, the state-owned national oil company of Saudi Arabia. Stark was awarded a two-year $560,000 grant from Saudi Aramco to genetically engineer a sulfur-eating bacterium to help clean the petroleum it produces.By removing the sulfur, Saudi Aramco would help to reduce the amount of acid rain produced by the burning of petroleum. Sulfur also corrodes the equipment used in the refining process. While chemical methods currently exist to remove the organic sulfur, it may turn out to be more cost-effective to use bacteria to break apart the naturally occurring sulfur-containing compounds and thus remove the sulfur from the petroleum, or at least lower the sulfur content considerably. Saudi Aramco produced 3.2 billion barrels of petroleum, or crude oil, in 2008 and managed nearly 260 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate reserves.\"Nobody really knows how many types of bacteria there are but there are likely bazillions of them,\" says Stark, with a laugh, adding that it's still unlikely that one, naturally occurring bacterium would have all the traits desired for the project. \"Bacteria are very resourceful organisms; they evolve very, very quickly and have a very short generation time, so what you can find if you look hard enough is a bacterial species that will eat just about anything. There are bacteria that have been identified, grown, and studied in isolation that are able to remove this organic sulfur. But they don't do it under conditions that would be practically useful.\"The goal of the IIT team is to combine together features of various bacteria to create one that is optimal for Saudi Aramco's needs: to eat sulfur at a five- to 10-fold rate faster than what takes place in the laboratory and at a temperature of about 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit). One current focus is on obtaining versions of the genes that encode the three enzymes, or proteins, responsible for the sulfur-eating property that are able to function efficiently at 60 degrees C. To isolate such genes, IIT students took soil samples from around IIT's Main Campus while Saudi Aramco scientists took their own samples from the desert. Both groups were in search of a bacterial species exhibiting this quality. A parallel search is on for a bacterial species that can thrive at 60 degrees C, that lends itself to genetic engineering, and that can be easily reproduced. One of Stark's students found such a strain that the group is now using in the project.A longtime distance runner, Stark has the patience and endurance to continue working to find just the right combination of genes.\"It's like having pieces of a puzzle partly put together,\" he explains. \"Right now, I'd say we've got the sky and the ground in place.\"Benjamin Stark:Saudi Aramco:Genetic engineering:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2009/art-paul-art-designing-playboy", "content": "The year 1953 produced its share of world-rocking events: James Watson and Francis Crick unraveled the structure of DNA, color television sets went on sale, and the Soviet Union detonated its first hydrogen weapon. In Chicago, two men set off a bomb of a different sort, blasting newsstands with a modest 72,000-issue run of a new publication at 50 cents per copy. With a smiling and waving Marilyn Monroe on its cover (and a less-than-modest nude photo of Monroe as Sweetheart of the Month on its centerspread), editor and founder Hugh Marston Hefner and art director Art Paul launched their magazine,.From the suave and sophisticated bachelor-about-town swagger of, no one would guess that Hefner came up with the idea for the publication as a young married man with an infant daughter and that Paul was also married, with a child on the way. Hefner learned of Paul, who was a freelance illustrator and designer at the time, through a mutual acquaintance and pursued Paul with the offer to design and art direct his magazine. The chance to assemble and lead the creative team of an exciting new magazine that featured popular culture, edgy fiction, profiles of the day's most compelling personalities, and, well, photos and art-erotica of beautiful women, grew on Paul. It also allowed him to apply the best of what he learned at a local school founded by the Hungarian painter, photographer, and professor L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy\u2014the(ID).\"I heard exciting things about ID\u2014the 'Chicago Bauhaus'\u2014about its busting out of traditional methods of teaching and its stress on experimentation, discovery, and unleashing oneself from old habits and conventions,\" explains Paul, a bit of an art rebel who found a good educational match in the bold philosophy espoused by ID. \"I'd started drawing as a child and always felt that opinions on what defined popular art and fine art as separate entities weren't valid,\" he says, noting that he admires the works of Norman Rockwell and Michelangelo alike.Born on the Southwest Side of Chicago, Paul later moved to the Rogers Park neighborhood, where he attendedand met an art teacher who thought him gifted enough to earn a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago. Then World War II summoned him and after a stint in the Army Air Corps, Paul chose to enroll at ID. Acknowledging that he may have been one of the students most anxious to express himself in the world of commercial art, it is no surprise that Paul created a symbol that has achieved worldwide recognition:'s rabbit head. He says that the rabbit almost began life as an adult male deer.\"Hef was very insistent that the magazine be called\u2014I told him it was madness,\" recalls Paul with a chuckle. There was already an outdoor magazine named, so the two men began thinking of other titles and animals that would represent a frisky slice of life. Eldon Sellers, another of Hefner's founding associates who went on to become a company executive, came up with the name. It took Paul about one hour to sketch his famous rabbit profile with the cocked ear and tuxedo tie. Paul intended originally for the symbol to be used as a characteristic endpoint to articles, but those plans changed, with the rabbit head instead becoming's corporate visual identity as well.As Paul settled into his position at, he tapped into the many resources available to him as a result of his education. \"My four years at ID had connected me to much of the art and design talent in Chicago, and the rest of the world,\" explains Paul, who received a Professional Achievement Award from the IIT Alumni Association in 1983. \"In my first years at, I commissioned artist and ID student Franz Altschuler to do several illustrations and artist and ID student Leon Bellin to illustrate's continuing 'Ribald Classic' feature. Chicago-area painters and sculptors such as Roy Schnakenberg, Ed Paschke, and Seymour Rosofsky were frequent contributors. I also commissioned printmaker Mish Kohn and photographer Arthur Siegel, former ID instructors, to do work for.\"Hefner, who is publisher, editor-in-chief, and chief creative officer for Playboy Enterprises, Inc., says that Paul's influence reached beyond the covers of. \"Arthur, quite frankly, was responsible for changing the nature of commercial illustration,\" he says. Hefner likens Paul to another multitalented artist who produced work for some ofbest-selling editions. \"He blurred the lines between fine art and commercial art just as the painter Andy Warhol did.\"If there was one word during Paul'syears that further motivated him to bring the \"high art of low art\"\u2014as Paul described it\u2014to readers, it was \"entertainment.\" The subtitle, \"Entertainment for Men,\" which has been part of each cover since its debut, served to crystallize the very essence offor Paul and charted a direction for him and his team. \"The 'entertainment' word is really the one that sparked me,\" he says. \"The word 'playboy' itself is not a serious one. The rabbit is not serious; it was basically a signal that we could make fun of ourselves.\"One way that Art Paul and his creative team engaged the reader was through a design technique he termed \"participatory graphics,\" using die-cuts, pull-outs, and pop-ups to keep the readers' attention focused on more than just the pin-ups. The article \"I Caught Flies for Howard Hughes,\" which appeared in the December 1975 issue, featured a cut-out that revealed a fly on the nose of an annoyed-looking man\u2014an example of the participatory graphics work Paul art directed.After his retirement as a vice president of the magazine in 1982, Paul continued to imprint his artistic style onto other projects, working on movie titles and designing posters for the Chicago Film Festival and the Art Institute. He has lectured widely across the country and internationally at universities, design schools, and art directors' clubs, and has served on the boards of various local organizations. In 2004, thehosted the exhibit I Read It for the Art: Chicago, Creativity, and, featuring Paul's works, along with the works of many of the Chicago artists he helped to establish.Among the many honors given to Paul include induction into theand the Herb Lubalin Lifetime Achievement Award from the.

Velocity will allow us to connect alumni with programs that are meaningful to them, such as mentorship and volunteer opportunities at IIT.\"The popularity of social-networking websites has made computers and PDAs the conduit for interpersonal meeting and interaction. Velocity takes a more personal approach, pairing students with alumni\u2014who will enjoy a natural connection through their affiliation with IIT\u2014in meaningful face-to-face discussions about their lives, inspiration, and successes.\"Anytime we connect alumni with students, it's magical.

He says the interviews, which will take place at alumni workplaces, are designed to be semi-structured conversations in order to better facilitate mutual sharing. \"We believe that the communication skills that we are sharing with these students will help them throughout their careers,\" he says. As an alumnus, Marcus believes alumni will look forward to learning about the many changes to IIT over the years.\"The students are really involved and enthusiastic,\" Marcus says, noting that many of the ambassadors are also participants in, a program that builds leadership and teamwork skills of students, as well as IIT Camras scholars. \"The training has allowed them to feel empowered with the interpersonal tools to do this job. I think that by talking to alumni, students will gain a much better sense of the history of IIT and how the university really does have a rich and noble history.\"Part of the training process involved pairing Velocity ambassadors with alumni interview subjects who agreed to offer feedback on their performances during practice sessions. Franke says the comments he received were helpful. In telling his own story, the alumnus Franke interviewed provided the type of information that IIT is looking to obtain from its alumni.\"My practice interviewee expressed his hope that IIT continues to strive for a reputation as a global institution that equips talented people with the skills and resources to do great things with their talent,\" Franke says. \"During our conversation, he mentioned that there were some good indications that IIT is going down that road.\"On his nationwide tour to meet alumni following his inauguration in early 2008, President Anderson said he had the opportunity to hear from many alumni about their relationship with IIT and their opinions about how the university can move forward.\"Velocity is an exciting initiative that will provide alumni more outlets for sharing their insights,\" Anderson says. \"In turn, IIT will be able to adapt and grow in a way that sustains our relationship with our alumni into the future.\"IIT's Velocity initiative:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/model-citizen", "content": "\"For as long as I can remember, I had an interest in the natural world around me\u2014how it worked, how things were put together,\" recalls Frederica Darema (M.S. PHYS '72) in a recent telephone conversation. \"Before I went to kindergarten,\" she says, pausing briefly before continuing with a tone of seeming wonder in her voice, \"I was thinking about how the clouds stayed up in the sky and how is it that we see the moon everywhere we go, that it seems to follow us.\"Darema's inquisitive nature\u2014encouraged by her father, a pharmaceutical chemist\u2014and her love of performing experiments in both elementary school and high school led to her focus on physics. A pamphlet about her native Greece's then new Nuclear Research Center \"Demokritos,\" now the National Centre of Scientific Research, became the catalyst for her scientific aspirations. She graduated from the School of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Athens and was awarded a six-year Fulbright Scholarship to attend Illinois Institute of Technology and then the University of California, Davis, where she obtained a Ph.D. in physics with an emphasis on theoretical nuclear physics.Her passion and aptitude for physics along with unswerving dedication to her work were fertile ground for Darema, who acknowledges plentiful opportunities to work with and be mentored by influential nuclear theorists beginning with her IIT years. Her research career path led her to develop the SPMD computational model for parallel and distributed computing, which continues to be the predominant model for supercomputing for more than 30 years now.\"My model allowed efficient ways of writing programs to exploit multiple computers, all working synergistically, to execute different parts of a computer program,\" explains Darema, who proposed the idea in 1983, while working as a research staff member at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center.\"As a physicist with a background in computational modeling, I thought of a completely different programming model for parallel computing than the fork/join (or master/slave) model that computer scientists were considering. Based on my understanding of physics models of nuclear phenomena, I was inspired and proposed the single program-multiple data model. The model was both democratic and capitalistic!\" she adds, in characteristic good humor.A few years earlier, when she was on the technical staff of Schlumberger-Doll Research Center, Darema had the idea for a new modeling paradigm that was well ahead of its time; the then-existing science and technologies were not advanced enough to support and implement the full capabilities of this new modeling method. After she developed her parallel-computing model and distributed computing was more commonly utilized, Darema pushed for her new concept through the InfoSymbiotics/Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) Program, which she began to set in motion in the late 1990s as senior science and technology advisor for the National Science Foundation.Recruited in 2010 by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) to be director of the Mathematics, Information and Life Sciences Directorate, Darema was given the opportunity one year later to build and manage her visionary computer science program exclusively. While the DDDAS concept\u2014which dynamically integrates modeling and instrumentation methods to analyze, understand, and manage the behavior of natural or engineered systems\u2014will largely contribute to Air Force and national security projects, it also creates new capabilities in a broad set of areas in the civilian and commercial sectors. With the DDDAS program, the onset and path of tornadoes, hurricanes, and the spread of volcanic ash can be more accurately predicted; the compositional integrity of engineered structures such as airplanes, bridges, and tall buildings can be more accurately assessed; and critical infrastructures such as electrical power grids and transportation can be more intelligently and effectively managed.Darema was elected an IEEE Fellow and received the Distinguished Professional and Technical Contributions Award and the Computer Society Award for Technical Achievements. Last spring, she was also honored with a 2013 IIT Professional Achievement Award. Sangtae Kim, Distinguished Professor at the Purdue University School of Chemical Engineering, notes that her IIT award is well deserved.\"Frederica Darema has made enormous contributions to the modern landscape of computational science,\" says Kim, a member of the National Academy of Engineering. \"In particular, the concept that she created and established\u2014DDDAS\u2014has proven to be a visionary paradigm for thinking about how big/dynamic data can be best incorporated into advanced mathematical/computational models; furthermore, DDDAS provides a powerful framework for implementing that vision into practice across some of the most important endeavors in applied science today. Fields as diverse as systems biology, advanced materials design, and energy production have all benefited from these computational advances.\"Thinking back to her IIT years, Darema remembers fondly her time as a student in the Department of Physics. She also enjoyed living on Main Campus, and visiting Chinatown and The Field Museum with her classmates. She admits, though, that she spent much of her time learning as well as on her research, especially at Argonne National Laboratory.\"Through the millennia, science and technology have played a major role in advancing civilization. Contributing my part in this has been very fulfilling,\" says Darema. \"Whatever I do in the future, I hope it will continue to capitalize on my experience and my track record, and provide me with challenges and opportunities to create new directions that will expand the horizons of science and technology.\"Editor's Note: IIT Magazine thanks the IIT Office of Alumni Relations for providing interview notes for this article.AFOSR:\"New Frontiers Through Information Technologies\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2009/rewind-revisited-iit-navy-v-12", "content": "In an effort to increase the number of college-educated officers called to serve their country during World War II, the federal government initiated a nationwide education effort in 1943 known as the. IIT's reputation as a leading academic institution headed by a patriotic president\u2014Henry T. Heald, who understood the importance of engineering knowledge in contributing toward a successful war outcome\u2014helped to position the university at the forefront of this effort. Before V-12 came to an end in 1946, more than 125,000 men were enrolled at 131 colleges and universities across the United States as program participants.I was glad to finally see an article on the Navy V-12 program at IIT. I was afraid IIT had forgotten. I was part of that program, playing in the Navy band for the kind of naval review shown in the photo.There is one correction I would suggest for your records. In the fifth paragraph you state that \"they would become eligible for an officer's commission upon graduation.\" I did not graduate with my class but received the commission nevertheless. I had had two semesters of college before joining the program and had just enough credits to graduate when I finished. Unfortunately, just a few weeks before the graduation ceremony, the dean of engineering found that three of my credits came from a mandatory course in the New Testament taken at Southwestern College (now Rhodes College) in Memphis, Tenn. He deemed that not appropriate for an IIT graduate, which took me below the necessary number of credits to graduate. I was commissioned, nonetheless, and went off to sea. Perhaps successful completion of the requisite number of semesters was more important to the Navy than graduation. I did come back to IIT later and completed more than enough to graduate, so all was well in the end.Mine is a sample of one story. Since the war had just ended, it may have been a \"what-the-heck\" case for the Navy, and it may or may not reflect the rules. But it did happen. Thanks for your article.I was quite intrigued by the article I found in the IIT Archives on the school's involvement with WWII efforts. My father was L. Roy Wilcox, who began his lengthy and rewarding career as a mathematics professor at IIT in 1940. He did not speak of the school's involvement with the V-12 program per se, but did mention that IIT had a prestigious role in training the men who went on to win the war. It was gratifying to read about the school in that context as it validated information I had but had not been able to completely confirm elsewhere. Your article is comprehensive and explains points of which I had only a vague understanding. Thank you.Do you know if Robert D. Newman (ME '43) was in this program? I was an enlisted man who served on the USS Hydrus, and Newman was an officer in the mechanical section. I subsequently met him once before I hosted a reunion of the Hydrus crew and later became the surviving editor of the periodical Masthead. I know his home addresses in Illinois and Florida but am curious about his education. My first wife also knew him from the IIT campus. Was there any other Navy program? When I arrived on the campus in the fall of 1947, I lived in graduate housing at the corner of 33rd and Michigan, sharing a study room with a senior in some Navy program and two freshmen in ROTC. I have been in some contact with the ROTC men, but Bill Jenkins graduated in 1948 and may have gone into the Marine Corps.I enjoyed reading your article.Response from IIT Archivist, Catherine Bruck: I have found some information on Robert D. Newman in the IIT Archives. It does appear that Mr. Newman, who is deceased, was in the V-12 program. As for other Navy programs at IIT, I am only aware of the V-12 program and the NROTC program. From time to time, other branches of the military also had ROTC units on our campus, including the Marines.I enjoyed your recent article about the V-12 unit at IIT and was reminded of my several years as an undergraduate there during the early years of WWII. While I served in the Navy during the war, I was not a member of the V-12 unit. I thought you might be interested in my undergraduate story.I began my electrical engineering studies in the fall of 1941 at age 17, and the following year when I registered for the draft, I was deferred to continue my engineering education as a civilian; this status persisted until 1944, when my local draft board was \"scraping bottom\" to meet their quota. In 1942, IIT adopted a three-semester year, compressing the four-year, bachelor-of-science engineering program into three years. So, in the space of less than three years, I had completed three-and-one-half years of school.During those years, the military services were periodically sending emissaries to the schools trying to recruit students. I attended all the meetings to hear their pitch. All the services were saying, \"Join now and we will assign you to stay here and finish your schooling. When you go on active duty, we'll give you a commission and you will be with a group of your choosing.\" It sounded good, but I was severely nearsighted and knew I couldn't pass the eye test required for a commission; so I never applied. Some of my friends who did join found that the services' plans and promises could be changed and soon their schooling days came to an end as they were called to active duty. I never found out if their commissions came through as promised, so I continued as a deferred draftee through the first semester of my senior year, which ended in January 1944.There were only a few of us civilians left in the senior electrical engineering class, which was augmented with Navy V-12 students beginning in about 1943. Most of these students transferred from other schools; I made several new friends, among them [the late] Dick Kuba (EE '44), whom I dealt with several years later when he worked for a contractor that did work for Teletype Corporation, where I was employed.One of the service delegations visiting IIT was different. A Lieutenant Commander Eddy made a Navy presentation and said that by passing the \"Eddy Test,\" we could pre-qualify to become Navy radar technicians. They would even accept me with my nearsighted vision! If I passed, I would be given a Seaman First Class rating (higher pay) and would be sent to a nine-month-long primary and secondary service school to learn equipment, theory, and maintenance procedures. The principal secondary school was at Navy Pier in Chicago. If I was interested in avionics, I would be transferred to Corpus Christi, Texas, for secondary school. Following graduation from secondary school, I would be assigned to the fleet or to a naval base. I liked the sound of this proposition and easily passed the test. Other civilian classmates of mine also passed the Eddy Test.I was inducted into the Navy in July 1944 and after boot camp at Great Lakes Naval Training Center, I began my Navy schooling at Michigan City, Ind., where I took a six-weeks pre-radio course. The Navy also offered the Eddy Test to high school seniors. A neighbor friend of mine passed the test and when he graduated from high school, he began his training. I served with him while we were stationed at the naval base in Gulfport, Miss., where we attended primary school in the fall and winter of 1944\u201345.Secondary school was at Navy Pier, Chicago. I considered myself fortunate that, unlike many of my relatives and friends in the service, no one was shooting at me and at the same time, I was furthering my education. Also, my duty station was close to my home in Maywood, Ill., where I was raised and was able to spend some weekends with my parents and sister. Our company graduated in September 1945 and the war was over. I earned a Radar Technician Third Class rate and was chosen to take additional training to become a service school instructor. I began teaching classes at the primary service school at Great Lakes and served there until my discharge in July 1946, with almost two years of active duty. By then, I had an Electronic Technician's Mate Second Class rate. I returned to IIT for my final semester in fall 1946 under the G. I. Bill and graduated in January 1947 as part of a small electrical engineering class with a few friends whom I had known before my naval duty.Thank you for your very nice article about the Navy V-12 program. I found it very interesting because I was there as one of the few civilian students with the V-12 men. I went though school on the same year-round basis as did the V-12, starting in July 1943 and graduating in February 1946 with a degree in mechanical engineering. We went to school all of the time; there were only four or five days off between semesters to register for the next semester's classes.I have been a Type-1 insulin-dependent diabetic since I was 13 (I am now 83) and so I was, of course, classed as 4-F as far as the military draft was concerned. The V-12 lived in what were the fraternity houses on Michigan Avenue, which were then called the Navy quarters. There were no dormitories; if you were from out of town, you would join a fraternity and live in the fraternity house. I lived in west suburban Oak Park, so I commuted to IIT on the El.IIT has been an important school in our family. My father, Arthur P. Strong, and his brother, Paul A. Strong, graduated in electrical engineering in 1909 and 1913, respectively. I graduated in 1946, and my daughter Catherine Strong Conway graduated in the last group IIT had in fire protection and safety engineering, in May 1985."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2012/second-run", "content": "Bridgeport's Ramova Theatre is an \"atmospheric-style\" theater, designed to remind moviegoers of a Spanish courtyard on a clear, star-filled night. But the theater closed in 1986 after a 57-year run, and now its dilapidated balconies and few remaining seats more closely resemble a ghost town from a Clint Eastwood western.For now, anyway. A group of Bridgeport residents and IIT students vows not to let the Ramova disappear into the sunset, and if they succeed, the Ramova will have a second act as a live performance venue. To get there, resident Maureen Sullivan's Save the Ramova campaign is soliciting support for a Ramova renovation while IIT students are assisting in her grassroots effort and also designing possibilities for a new Ramova.This spring semester marks the fourth term that an IIT Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program team has joined the effort. As part of IPRO 2.0, a new version of IPRO that allows the same student team to work on a project for more than one semester, the team devoted its first semesters to gauging neighborhood support for a renovation effort, then to exploring potential uses for the theater. The nine students on the IIT team during the spring 2012 semester worked on designs and began to seek fundraising for the project.True to IPRO's interdisciplinary approach, the Ramova team combines architects, engineers, and designers with business and humanities majors who work on fundraising strategies and building awareness and support for the project, as well as ensuring that the new Ramova is built for maximum community benefit.It's also very meaningful for the students involved.\"You feel a strong sense of connection when you're working on this kind of community-based project,\" says Danilo Fontana (BAAS 2nd year), who joined the IPRO 2.0 team this semester. The theater \"has the potential to be an economic and cultural catalyst for Bridgeport,\" he says.Many believe that a restored Ramova could anchor a shopping, dining, and entertainment district along south Halsted Street, an area with many empty storefronts. With a renewed Ramova, \"the Halsted corridor could be reactivated, and that would be huge,\" according to Limia Shunia, an adjunct professor who leads the IIT team.Sullivan, who leads the renovation effort as a board member of the nonprofit Ramova Theatre Foundation, says the IIT students' contribution has been invaluable\u2014and impressively disciplined.\"They could have put together a floor-plan of what they imagined for the space, but instead they are really focused on what the community wants,\" she says.As a result, another generation of Bridgeporters may get the chance to be transported to a Spanish courtyard\u2014Ramova-style."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2008/dare-object", "content": "In the fall of 1957, two girls in their sophomore year atin Little Rock, Ark., passed notes to each other across the aisle of their classroom. Gloria's note read, \"Becky, I see you in the hallway, but I don't know if you want me to say hello or not.\" Becky's response expressed more than a case of new-school-year nervousness. \"Gloria, I see you, too, but please, don't say hello to me,\" the note read. \"The white citizens' council has spies everywhere and I don't want to put my family in danger.\"Although it had been more than three years since the United States Supreme Court ruled on the unconstitutionality of racial segregation in public schools with thedecision of May 17, 1954, Arkansas Governor Orval E. Faubus resisted the ruling, which was to begin at the high-school level in the Little Rock School District (LRSD). On September 23, 1957, nine African-American students, including 14-year-old Gloria Ray, now Gloria Ray Karlmark (CHEM, MATH '65), decided to rightfully claim what the Supreme Court said was theirs. Against a crowd of some 1,000 protestors, they entered the all-white high school and into the chronicles of history.Karlmark never expected the ugly reception she and the other \"Little Rock Nine\" experienced that day, or that by a direct order from Governor Faubus, the Arkansas National Guard would bar them from entering school on the first day of class, September 2, 1957. According to Karlmark, Arkansas of the 1950s was generally considered to be more progressive than other states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, and had already lifted its ban on such laws as those that relegated African Americans to the rear of buses.\"We lived in neighborhoods that were integrated; I had white neighbors,\" explains Karlmark, who visited Main Campus of Illinois Institute of Technology in May to receive the. \"I grew up with white kids and they grew up with me. We went to different schools, but we played together. No one expected what happened because people knew one another.\" African-American students in Little Rock attended Dunbar High School, which had a good academic reputation but had fewer course selections and classrooms than Little Rock Central, and lacked an athletics practice field.Shortly after the Supreme Court decision was made, thewent before the LRSD to begin integration. Karlmark's historic walk was delayed for two years as various strategies were initiated to prevent integration from happening. The LRSD immediately adopted the Blossom Plan, which called for gradual integration\u2014to begin in high schools in 1957 and to be followed by grade schools in subsequent years. In early 1957, the Arkansas State Legislature continued to block integration by approving four 'segregation bills' and instituting a 3 percent sales tax on the election ballot to ensure that funds would be available to continue its efforts. Citizens groups, such as theand the, joined in the protest by placing anti-integration advertisements in newspapers and holding rallies. One month before school was scheduled to open, the governor of Georgia gave his support to Faubus, going so far as to commend those who supported a concept known as \"state's rights,\" that is, the right of a state to oppose the federal government.After Karlmark and her classmates were denied entrance to Little Rock Central on September 2, federal judge Ronald Davies ordered integration to begin two days later. Again, on September 4 the way was blocked for African-American students. As increased chaos ensued, Davies began legal proceedings against Faubus and several guardsman for interfering with integration. The rioting that occurred once the Little Rock Nine finally entered the school on September 23 was so intense that President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered in units from the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division to help restore calm. Troops remained on campus for nearly one month to escort the nine throughout their school day.Once the troops left, the problems returned and remained with the Little Rock Nine until the end of the academic year. Only one student in the group graduated from Little Rock Central before the school was officially closed for 1958-59 after Faubus signed into law a bill that allowed him to shut down a district school that was facing integration, pending a public vote.Because of the many traumatic experiences Karlmark endured at Little Rock Central, it was well into adulthood before she could speak openly about her time at the school. \"During that year, the nine of us didn't share with each other our problems,\" she says, noting that each of them was assigned to separate classrooms, only getting together for lunch. \"At the end of the day we'd say, 'It was okay' or 'I managed.' We were trying to keep up our morale and not say anything that was going to make somebody decide not to come back,\" explains Karlmark. \"We didn't want to worry our parents so we just kept it in.\"The nine suffered physical and mental abuse, as did those who associated with them. Karlmark recalls the kindness of Becky, who passed notes with her so many years ago. She shares what Becky meant in presentations she gives about bullying and the 'silent majority' to grade school children in Sweden, where she has lived for more than 40 years with her husband, Krister (M.S. DESG '69), a former IIT Institute of Design faculty member.\"Becky couldn't say hello to me in the hallway, but she did show friendship to me in the classroom. She did what she could do,\" says Karlmark. \"I tell the kids not to sit back and watch it and talk about it. There's bound to be some little thing, however little it might seem in your mind, that you can do to improve conditions. What Becky considered as just a little thing, for me, was my whole world. She was the only kid in any class I had who saw me. I used to look forward to that class because there would at least be one person who saw me as a fellow human being who bled when hurt and who had feelings.\"Karlmark acknowledged that while the majority of students weren't cruel, most simply didn't \"dare to object to what was wrong.\" One student stood out because she did object. Robin Wood, the daughter of a local journalist, was openly friendly to each of the Little Rock Nine. \"She and her family were treated exactly as we were,\" recalls Karlmark. \"The difference was she didn't have a soldier escorting her between classes\u2014she was on her own. That took real courage.\" A few years before the 50th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine on September 25, 2007, Karlmark was asked what she would like inscribed at the foot of a statue made in her likeness. Her answer? \"Dare to object to prejudice and injustice.\"With Little Rock Central shuttered for the 1958-59 academic year, Karlmark traveled to Missouri to live with her uncle and to attend the newly integrated Kansas City Central High School, where she was placed in the Advanced Studies Program. \"It was a wonderful school,\" says Karlmark. \"It was that school that led to my coming to IIT.\" Encouraged by her female chemistry teacher to apply to the university, Karlmark did and stepped into a realm of new possibilities.\"IIT taught me how to go about learning,\" she says, explaining that with this skill, she was able to smoothly transition from a multifaceted technology career to a new one as a patent attorney. Upon her graduation, Karlmark spent four years at IIT Research Institute, where she worked as an assistant mathematician on the Automatically Programmed Tools IV Project. After taking a year's sabbatical, Karlmark and her husband immigrated to Sweden, where she joined theand in 1975, completed the company's Patent Examiner Program, moving into its international patent operations as a European patent attorney. In 1976, Karlmark cofounded the international journal Computers in Industry, serving as its editor-in-chief for 15 years. Before her retirement in 1994, Karlmark worked as a management specialist for Philips International, traveling to many countries in Europe.The IIT Alumni Medal is just one of many honors Karlmark has received over the years. She and the Little Rock group have been commemorated on a postage stamp and a silver dollar, and memorialized in a bronze statue displayed on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol. In 1999, the nine visited the White House, where President Bill Clinton bestowed upon them the, the highest form of civilian recognition. Little Rock Central High School, still part of the LRSD, is now a National Historic Site. Mother of two children\u2014Elin, a marketing strategist, and Mats, an IT communications specialist\u2014Karlmark wishes her own parents were alive to see the direction her life has taken since she walked up the steps of Little Rock Central. \"It was totally beyond the realm of possibility,\" she says. \"I take it as another tribute to how great the United States is.\"The Little Rock Nine established a foundation to hold in the public's memory their actions that September day and to provide scholarship and mentorship for youth in poor-performing school districts. Nine high school students from around the country were selected to receive $10,000 scholarships at the 50th anniversary commemorative event, including Lindsey Brown, now a second-year physics major at Fisk University. One of only a few African-American students at her elementary school in Rhode Island and, as she recalls, the only African-American student in her fifth-grade class, Brown says that she was strengthened by the story of the Little Rock Nine during that time. \"I did not face the adversity that they faced, but I do understand the discomfort they must have felt,\" she explains. Because of the distance that separates them, Brown and her mentor, Karlmark, have relied upon electronic communication. \"This has been one of the greatest experiences of my life,\" says Brown. \"I will forever cherish the emails and personal relationship with Mrs. Karlmark.\"By means of scholarship and mentorship opportunities, the Little Rock Nine are continuing the legacy passed down to them by their parents and educators who helped them keep alive their dream of bettering themselves through knowledge. \"We were willing to die inside that school,\" says Karlmark, who explains that while it was her desire to obtain the best learning opportunities that she could, when she stepped inside Little Rock Central, her desire matured into something more: a principle. \"It was the principle of being an American citizen, not a second-class American citizen but children of one and the same God, not children of a lesser god,\" she says. \"I was brought up that education was the way of the future.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010", "content": "\"Tell me and I forget.

First, and perhaps most fundamental, is determining a generally accepted definition of sustainability\u2014\"one man's green is another man's gray,\" Clair says\u2014which can differ from college to college based on varying disciplines and perspectives.Other key challenges include reducing the use of natural resources\u2014namely water, steel, and masonry\u2014as well as energy use in business and facilities.\"We have a diversity of building styles\u2014residential, commercial, industrial, retail\u2014so it's difficult to have a single energy-use strategy for the entire campus,\" Clair notes. Whereas determining a base pattern of energy use in a typical residential building is relatively straightforward, for example, students live and work at different times of the day, which makes assessing energy needs in student residences more challenging. Similarly, as opposed to many commercial businesses, IIT has some facilities with 24-hour use patterns, including labs, as well as other special energy requirements.\"We have to think at a micro level about how each building is used, and we have to use only the resources that we need. Our vision for sustainability has to be applied to everything at all levels of our operations,\" he says. \"If we do this we will increase the quality of life on campus, which advances our educational and research mission.\"\"If you consider the three components of sustainability\u2014environmental, social, and economical\u2014IIT will benefit in all three aspects,\" says George P. Nassos, director of the Center for Sustainable Enterprise at IIT Stuart School of Business. As part of its mission, the CSE advises business leaders about how they can alter their business practices to be more sustainable, thereby improving the environment as well as their company's bottom line.\"By being environmentally sustainable, the university is utilizing fewer natural resources; if it's social, we're reducing our carbon footprint, which reduces climate change and impacts people, whether a change affects agriculture or rising flood waters. By using fewer natural resources, we are also being economically sustainable; we pay less, use less wattage, save on disposal, and prevent pollution.\"If we look at the economic aspect even further, promoting and advertising our sustainability will contribute to attracting higher-quality students, which impacts our revenue and helps the bottom line. It's good to do it, even if you don't tell anyone, but even better if you do.\"Clair says successful sustainability is well within reach for IIT. \"IIT has so much knowledge in this area and sustainability here is inbred,\" he says. \"Also, we're an urban school. If we can show that we can make sustainability work here, in a diverse community within the city, using a forward-thinking model, we can establish a standard for other small communities in the Chicago area and urban centers all over the world.\"A partner in developing a more sustainable IIT is the University Sustainability Committee. Formed two years ago, the committee, headed by Said Al-Hallaj, research associate professor of chemical and biological engineering, is an interdisciplinary collective of faculty working in sustainability-related research. The committee's goal is to educate faculty about the various sustainability initiatives being developed as part of IIT's operations and to provide input into the decision-making.\"The most important message we emphasize is that sustainability shouldn't be driven by saving costs only,\" says Al-Hallaj. \"As a university with a history in this area, we have to walk the walk. We must practice sustainability and be a leader for IIT stakeholders, the community, and the rest of the world.\"The committee has been working with the university to replace worn-out IIT vehicles with vehicles that use the best new green technology, including pure-electric small vehicles for parking, general operations, and security staffs. IIT currently has three all-electric vehicles in use.Through these changes and other efforts, IIT aspires to be a \"sustainable village\"\u2014a model for small communities that going green is feasible. This includes exporting successful strategies to other city neighborhoods, applying methods that have worked within IIT's own grid within the cityscape to other areas. IIT plans to show the City of Chicago how planned upgrades at the McCormick Student Village student residence could be applied in the construction of a 2016 Olympic Village.Ironically, when such sustainability is fully integrated, whether on IIT's campus or applied elsewhere, observers may have to look hard to find it. \"The best sustainability is the things people won't notice,\" Clair observes. \"We'll see it on a balance sheet in the things we don't purchase.\"The University Sustainability Policy will serve as a framework for a centralized greening plan, which includes the further development of IIT operations initiatives that have begun in the past year.The Perfect Power Prototype\u2014one of the more ambitious and comprehensive new endeavors at IIT\u2014will redefine the way the university acquires, produces, distributes, and uses energy. This project, led by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and in partnership with theand Exelon, is funded in part through a sizeable grant from the(DOE) announced in June 2008. The research project aims to model a flagship Perfect Power solution to the country's energy problems\u2014using IIT as a living laboratory.Power outages cost the United States an estimated $150 billion annually. The one to three outages that IIT experiences each year result in nearly $500,000 in restoration costs, irrecoverable experiments, and lost productivity.The high-reliability distribution system of the Perfect Power Prototype at IIT will integrate various energy platforms across Main Campus. Each numbered loop represents a redundant system designed to increase the security and reliability of energy delivery.A more robust recycling program at IIT will include a website,, to keep the university community aware of specific recycling initiatives and how individuals can become involved.The initiative will make IIT a prototype for improved efficiency, self-sustaining generation, and renewable energy applications based on a system of smart grids. Smart grids rely on a web of smart meters to monitor and dictate energy use at optimal times and costs. Mohammad Shahidehpour, ECE chair and a lead on the Perfect Power Prototype at IIT, likens smart meters to cell phone plans. \"If you make a call on your cell phone after 9 p.m., the calls are cheaper,\" he says.With a smart grid, master controllers set up in every neighborhood receive signals from the utility company regarding the real-time cost of electricity. The master controllers communicate with chips inside home appliances, for example, and determine use based on the owners\u2014preferred schedule and optimal times relative to cost, reducing the amount of electricity in the neighborhood or the city at any given time. \"That's a smart grid,\" says Shahidehpour. \"The price is a function of time. You'll pay less.\"Through Perfect Power, IIT would be self-sustaining and more efficient in its electricity generation as well. IIT currently has its own central power plant\u2014a gas-fired combined unit that can generate about 8 megawatts of power but that is used only for heating and hot water due to the high cost of gas. Because IIT uses a maximum of 12-14 megawatts during peak times, in the summer, this plant could provide approximately two-thirds of the university's power, as opposed to purchasing power from offsite providers\u2014the current, cheaper option.By purchasing electricity in real-time and using onsite generation, IIT estimates that it could save from $500,000 to $1.5 million annually.The five-year DOE grant will support the improvement of the campus infrastructure\u2014the purchase of additional generating units, enhancement of existing buildings, and an upgrade of the cable system. This involves reassessing the entire power grid at IIT, which consists of a low-voltage distributed system that relies primarily on old, overworked underground cables. The grant will support another aspect of Perfect Power, the installation of solar panels on the rooftop of Siegel Hall and exploration of other renewable electricity generation.Through Perfect Power, the IIT model will show lawmakers how a more innovative approach to the energy dilemma, including new laws and regulations, is needed if the country is to eliminate power outages and drive down the cost and pollution associated with electricity. The Perfect Power Prototype is scheduled to begin this fall.The largest user of natural gas at IIT is the central heating plant, the culprit in many locales with long, cold winters. With modern hot-water systems running at 90 percent efficiency or greater, switching out old equipment saves both resources and money.IIT has replaced a 60,000-pound boiler with two high-efficiency 20,000-pound boilers that can respond to seasonal changes in demand loads. This change alone is expected to save $425,000 in fuel costs each year and to reduce carbon emissions by 3.5 million pounds annually. IIT also began construction to install a high-efficiency hot water/steam plant on the east side of Main Campus. By upgrading its system, IIT is expected to reduce COemissions by 10.4 million pounds annually while better accommodating any future system upgrades.This fall, IIT will unveil a new recycling program that it expects will increase recycling rates considerably. The more pervasive, transparent program will feature three major components: enhanced presence of recycling bins and stations throughout residences and common areas, increased training of support staff that handle recyclables, and an improved process for hauling, documenting, and reporting on the program's progress.A component of the reporting includes the launch of recycling.iit.edu at the start of the academic year. The website will keep the community informed about the recycling initiative and what each person can do to make the program a success.IIT is working with the city to turn 31st Street on campus into a permeable street. This includes exploring new methods of wastewater management, which would help IIT make more efficient use of water procured on Main Campus. Currently, any water reclaimed at IIT must travel through Chicago's central water-reclamation facilities, located several miles away.The average American generates 47 pounds of COper day, enough to fill 47 2.5-foot-wide balloons. Gasoline accounts for a third of this, with each gallon of gas producing 25.3 pounds of CO. Another source of our carbon output is the electricity from coal and natural gas power plants, which produces an average of 1.34 pounds per kilowatt hour when in use."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2009/new-grid-town-perfect-power-system-ramps-iit", "content": "The greek philosopher Aristotle is credited with authoring the earliest definition of the word perfection, which he saw as being composed of three concepts: \"That is perfect-which is complete, which contains all the requisite parts; which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better; and which has attained its purpose.\" In disciplines from the aesthetics to ethics, how individuals define perfection ranges from being an approximate ideal to something so ambitious as to be unattainable.A group of energy visionaries comprising the(GEI) subscribe to Aristotle's bold and decisive definition in regard to perfect power and their innovative plan to reinvent the nation's electricity transmission, generation, and delivery network. Three years ago, GEI members and IIT faculty developed their idea to create a Perfect Power System on the university's Main Campus. The group then elicited help from the(DOE), creating a three-faceted partnership between government, education, and industry to make the Perfect Power energy-distribution system the first of its kind in the country.\"We own our own power plant, distribution systems, and wires throughout the campus,\" says, professor and chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and Perfect Power principal investigator, of IIT's 120-acre Main Campus. \"The university is like a city. So whatever we can do here can be replicated in cities and other large entities across the country.\"The Perfect Power transformation will be completed in four phases over the next five years. Central to this conversion is a technology touchstone\u2014a smart microgrid\u2014that ultimately will be a model for revamping our nation's antiquated and outage-ridden power grid.\"Perfection\u2014and let me define that as we have defined it for GEI\u2014is that every consumer of electricity, large or small, can be absolutely assured of getting the quantity and quality of electricity that they need at the fairest price without any concern about it ever failing. That is, in our judgment, a very achievable goal,\" said Kurt Yeager, GEI executive director, at a press conference announcing the launch of. The conference was held November 19, 2008, in Siegel Hall, the first building that will be reconfigured in the Perfect Power plan.At the conference, Yeager was joined by IIT President John Anderson; GEI founder and IIT University Regent Robert W. Galvin, former chair and CEO of Motorola, Inc.; representatives from project partners(ComEd),, and; and Shahidehpour. Perfect Power at IIT is one of nine projects that received DOE funding for smart grid research. In addition to the $7 million DOE grant, Perfect Power received $5 million in funding from the university.Galvin told conference attendees that he was inspired to form GEI after his wife, Mary, became one of the estimated 40 million Americans affected by a blackout that shut down cities in eight Northeastern states in the summer of 2003. During his tenure at Motorola, Galvin was instrumental in significantly improving quality standards through implementation of Six Sigma, a business philosophy that values defect prevention over defect detection. According to the GEI, the nation's current electricity system accounts for at least $150 billion lost each year on power outages and interruptions. Smart grid technology could ramp up system reliability to 99.99 percent.The application of Six Sigma quality principles, coupled with the support of IIT's electricity supplier, ComEd, in the goal of achieving a perfect system sets the university's smart microgrid project apart from power conversions taking place at two other schools. After attending Six Sigma training courses, IIT team members established a basis for the microgrid by developing electricity system performance metrics based on consumers' needs, applying error proofing to the IIT electricity system design, and developing cost-effective means to lessen failures and system shortcomings.Source: U.S. Department of EnergyIIT's Main Campus averages three power failures each year at a cost of $500,000 annually in restoration expense, lost productivity, and ruined experiments. IIT is currently operating at capacity and in order to accommodate the increasing power requirements and digital demands, a new $5 million substation has been considered for the east side of campus to supplement two existing substations. Although Main Campus has the capability to generate essential power if there is a ComEd failure, its cogeneration plant is only cost effective at producing hot water, not the hot water, steam, and electricity it was originally meant to generate.\"Perfect Power consists of more than just the infrastructure upgrades that we are currently implementing on campus; however, the infrastructure improvements provide the foundation for every other electrical energy project that we will pursue over the next decades,\" says Joseph Clair (M.S. MAE '95), director of campusenergy and sustainability.The nation's century-old electric grid, hailed by the National Academy of Engineering as \"the most significant engineering achievement of the twentieth century,\" is dominated by central generation through largely fossil fuel-driven power plants, which deliver electricity via a system of regional grids that are owned or run by utility companies. Its 300,000-mile network of transmission lines, subject to weather conditions and physically sagging under the burden of increased usage demands, crisscross the country on their way to delivering electricity to homes and businesses.According to the DOE, since 1982, growth in peak demand for electricity needs has exceeded the construction of new transmission lines by 25 percent. When an outage occurs, large populations of grid users can be left without power, sometimes for days at a time. Additionally, the centrally located design of the grid leaves it more vulnerable to terrorist attack. More numerous microgrids supplying power to cities and essential buildings would make such an attack far less widespread.While the IIT community can expect to see some physical changes in the campus landscape as Perfect Power unfolds, other modifications will occur at the cyber-level as the microgrid works to advance and integrate a powerhouse composed of three technologies: a high reliability distribution system (HRDS), smart metering, and renewable energy sourcing.Serving as the core of the smart microgrid, the fully automated HRDS will operate as an electrical feeder loop system that sequesters power faults and reroutes power flows, essentially functioning as a self-healing circuit.developed by S&C Electric will replace outdated manual switches and breakers, sensing electrical changes and shifting power without interrupting usage in IIT's buildings.Distribution lines, visible above many neighborhoods in the Chicago area, are located underground on Main Campus. Each building and the cogeneration plant will be outfitted with an external, above-ground switch, protected from the elements in a watertight metal box, which will manage power throughout the underground lines. Another external unit\u2014a master controller\u2014will send information to the switches to ensure that the grid remains in an ideal mode of operation and also provide information to ComEd to help manage power during periods of peak usage or emergency situations, such as threatening weather. If a power outage occurs, a signal will be sent via a wireless connection from the controller to ComEd, making it easier for the utility to pinpoint the damaged circuitry. Research to enhance this automated distribution system is being led by, ECE associate professor, coupled with research on fault detection in the buried distribution lines being led by(Ph.D. EE '02), ECE assistant professor.A second controller will work to increase energy efficiency by communicating with intelligent sensors attached to equipment such as water heaters; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment; and lighting devices. On-off power switches will become a thing of the past, as the sensors will even determine whether a room is occupied and adjust the lights accordingly. Chi Zhou, ECE assistant professor, is working on these and other sensors that can be programmed to complete a task\u2014be it washing laboratory glassware or completing an experiment\u2014by a certain time, with the controller-sensor unit deciding the most efficient time to run.Siegel Hall will also be fitted with a smart meter that, like a standard electric meter, will indicate power is being used, but unlike a standard meter, will record usage in real time. This additional feature will enable IIT to determine the most cost-effective schedule for using power. Though the cost of electricity is currently fixed, using the new system, the university will have the choice to buy or generate and sell back power depending on the real-time price.\"The Siegel Hall component of the current phase will give us in campus operations a view into what is possible as we look to make IIT the most sustainable, urban university campus in the country,\"says Clair.At current power costs, avoiding peak-period usage will save the university at least 15 cents on each kilowatt-hour. Projections indicate that Perfect Power at IIT will effect a 15 percent reduction in overall demand and a 50 percent reduction in peak demand from ComEd. The smart meters will also measure the power generated by renewable energy sources, such as the solar panels being planned for the roof of Siegel Hall, which will be used to fuel a plug-in hybrid vehicle charging port set up next to the building.\"Smart grid technology is based on making the electric grid safer, more reliable, more efficient, and more secure,\" says Brianna Swenson (EE '04, M.S. '05), who served as an electrical/design engineer on Perfect Power at IIT during her employment with S&C Electric. \"Any one of these improvements is beneficial to the average person all on its own, but tying all four together is what the smart grid movement is all about.\"(M.S. GE '75, Ph.D. '78), Henry R. Linden Professor of Energy and director of the Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research (WISER) at IIT, notes that the project is in line with WISER's mission to advance the quality of life for all citizens.\"As a WISER initiative, the Perfect Power system demonstrates the institute's commitment to improving the energy efficiency and security of our nation,\" he says.\u2014Improve overall efficiency of Main Campus and the reliability of the ComEd system\u2014Modify existing IIT turbines for fast-start ability and add additional substation generation capabilities to carry campus demand\u2014Create the HRDS to interface with the dynamic campuswide energy system controller\u2014Provide local uninterrupted power supplies, solar power, and demand response capability to complete the projectWhile eliminating costly power outages and reducing dependence on traditional energy sources are good enough reasons for the United States to take steps toward perfecting its present power system, there is another compelling reason: global leadership.\"Electricity infrastructure is a way of measuring the progress of any country in the world,\" says Shahidehpour. \"The power systems of India and China are by far more advanced than what we have in the United States because these countries have spent more money and have revamped their systems in recent years.\", a state-run company established by the government in 1989 to create a unified power grid, has already maintained network availability for power transfer at 99.65 percent, which places it among the most efficient transmission utilities in the world. China's target year for the unification of the country's regional and provincial grid system is 2020. Plans include a possible link to Thailand's power grid network, as well as to Russia's grid.In the United States, President Barack Obama signed into effect the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 17 that includes $11 billion in credits and incentives for smart grids. In his \"New Energy for America\" plan, the president specifies investing in advanced smart grid technologies such as smart metering and distributed storage to help ensure that both energy use and costs will be significantly lower than they are now. That smart grid technology encourages user participation increases opportunities for consumers to actively partner with the government in the effort to increase the country's energy efficiency.And on the South Side of Chicago, one town-like university campus will be leading the way for all Americans to count on having power that is, in essence, perfect.\"The Perfect Power development and demonstration project provides a unique opportunity for DOE, Exelon, IIT, and the Galvin Electricity Initiative to work together to develop and demonstrate the distribution system of the future,\" says Terence Donnelly, ComEd senior vice president of transmission and distribution operations. \"IIT is ideally suited to serve as a test bed for joint research and demonstration activities, and we see significant potential for the collaboration to produce advanced distribution system technologies that can be applied to the ComEd system to improve reliability and reduce operating costs.\"United States Department of Energy:Galvin Electricity Initiative:Gridwise\u00ae Architecture Council:IIT Perfect Power System:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2011/letter-president", "content": "Soren KierkegaardAt IIT, a lot has changed over the years.

In one of my favorite orientation weekend traditions, the freshmen compete to win a bookstore gift certificate by coming up with the corniest joke. (We like to take it easy on freshmen during their first days at IIT\u2014after all, things get a lot tougher in the coming four years.) The winner: \"What happened to the frog that parked illegally? It was toad!\" This was submitted by Ben Jakobcic, an aerospace engineering major from Royal Oaks, Mich.What I enjoy even more than announcing the winning freshmen class joke is the opportunity to meet our new students as they embark on one of the most exciting journeys of their lives. And of course, I am honored that these talented young adults have chosen to study at IIT. It is always very rewarding to hear their goals and ambitions, and to remind them of the many ways that IIT will enrich them intellectually and personally, and provide them with the tools for a lifetime of learning and achievement.As the stories in this issue of IIT Magazine demonstrate, IIT's people give our new students much to be excited about. For example, our faculty members across the disciplines are providing leadership to help the United States manufacturing sector advance its global positioning, both by advancing design at our Institute of Design and through the Manufacturing Productivity Center, spearheaded by Professor Keith McKee. Our Mathematics and Science Education department, under the leadership of Professor Norman Lederman, is developing targeted programs and partnerships to improve the quality of secondary math and science teaching and learning. And our faculty are creating sustainable energy alternatives, working with government and private industry to teach them how these alternatives can help counter rising gas prices as well as a deteriorating global environment; a story about the recent sustainability efforts of Professor Said Al-Hallaj appears in this issue.Our returning students are also a source of great pride, exemplified by a group of committed student leaders responsible for a campaign to \"bring back The Bog,\" a venue that holds nostalgic value for many of you.

They are now joined by millions of people for whom the term \"going green\" has become a cultural phenomenon. While improving technology may be a positive residual, theirs is a motivation to ignite change in society, and a mountain of statistics supports the need. Through their work, they will educate and persuade others to take part in this movement; the IIT Green Home and Cool Globes projects are two such examples.On the other end of the spectrum are those who are responding to a shift in the needs of the market and of science. As consumers increasingly demand eco-friendly products\u2014cars, fuels, building materials, food, and clothing\u2014the science behind and design of these goods in many cases require a shift in technology. Having identified a need, these researchers want to be on the cutting edge of advancements, indeed changes, in this exciting area of research. For someone like alumna Susan Solomon, research that may yield environmental ramifications is not a matter of politics but of science.Ultimately the reasons for the pursuit are not as important as the determination to take on the challenges that this pursuit inevitably presents. The challenges are many. Can greener technologies be more cost effective than current technologies? What are the costs versus benefits in the relationships between energy and green technologies? How is the public culture shifted toward greener technologies, for example hybrid-powered vehicles, when the economics are not persuasive in today's world? How does the United States become a role model for the entire world in sustainability?At IIT a determination\u2014call it attitude, spirit, or ambition\u2014to explore these questions and others like them is rooted in a strong passion for both learning and seizing challenges. The university is united in its determination to create change, no matter how disparate the reasons for pursuing it may be. IIT's tenacity is infectious, and certainly played no small part in my decision to go to a one-car household.On a fundamental level, the want and need to pursue sustainability both lead to the same outcome\u2014 to leave the world for our children in the same or better condition than we inherited it. This is an important part of the IIT mission, one that has already affected me and no doubt countless others in both societal and scientific contexts.

The successes that we have had during the past two decades have been the result of the creativity, risk taking, and hard work of many people. There are 31 of them who have contributed their thoughts to this magazine.Any discussion of my time as president must begin with Bob Pritzker and Bob Galvin. These larger-than-life leaders have inspired the university community with their generosity, their leadership as Board of Trustees chairs, and their personal commitment of countless hours to the life of the university.Each of the wonderful new academic programs described in this magazine took leadership from their founding directors, risk taking by their funders, and the creative energy of many faculty and staff. It is this combination that has led to such early success for Mathematics and Science Teacher Education, Biomedical Engineering, the Leadership Academy, and the Interprofessional Projects program. These programs have enhanced the academic opportunities for our students. But there have been many more. The faculty has continually improved the curriculum and created new degrees at the cutting edge of education.The development of the Camras program transformed the academic quality of our undergraduate student body. The faculty were thrilled when the fi rst class arrived with students such as Lisa Marszalek and Nancianna Schaaper who did so much during their days as students to enrich the quality of student life. The students have been a continuing source of inspiration to me. They have made it all worthwhile.The development of Main Campus has been the most visible change during my time as president. It all began when Dirk Lohan created a Master Plan for redevelopment that helped us all imagine a radically transformed campus. The resulting McCormick Tribune Campus Center and State Street Village are the most visible of the physical changes. Having world-class architects Rem Koolhaas and Helmut Jahn design these buildings underscored our commitment to the tradition of architectural excellence. The renovation of S. R. Crown Hall and its designation as a National Historic Landmark, as well as the creation of the Mies van der Rohe Society, sent a signal to the worldwide architectural community of our continuing commitment to protecting our Miesian heritage.As important, the establishment of University Technology Park At IIT and completion of the fi rst building has set the course for an exciting new era in technology entrepreneurship.Finally, none of the progress we have made would have been possible without signifi cant additional fi nancial resources. The IIT Challenge Campaign that raised $270 million from alumni and friends provided the launch. The creation of Alion Science and Technology Corporation, through the brilliant leadership of Bahman Atefi , provided the additional funds for us to reach a stable fi nancial orbit.The university slogan is \"Transforming Lives. Inventing the Future.\" Those are powerful words that capture the mission of this university. It is this mission that gives meaning to what we do. It is why it is so satisfying to be a member of a university community, and it is why I am so grateful to all of you and the trustees for having given me the chance to serve this university.As I return to the faculty, I look forward to being part of this great university community for many years.

The center studies bioactive compounds delivered through plant foods that target cells in the body responsible for inflammation, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Unlike essential nutrients, bioactive compounds are not required for life, but growing evidence indicates they are closely linked with improved health and disease risk reduction.Many of the center's studies profile the biological qualities of red, blue, and purple fruits. These fruits contain a unique chemical signature of bioactive pigment compounds called anthocyanins, along with other phenolic compounds known for their antioxidant properties. However, the center's work has demonstrated that these compounds do much more than reduce oxidative stress in humans; they work to reduce inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which have roots in modern-day chronic diseases.The center also has studied potatoes, grape seeds, and other produce [see sidebar]. Wild blueberries, the topic of a current study, illustrate how mind and body are interconnected through metabolic stress/balance. Blueberries are known for their effects on cognition in older adults, but research at Illinois Tech is analyzing earlier periods in life to study the relationship between metabolic abnormalities and inflammation in middle age and how they impact brain function. The role of wild blueberry bioactives in moderating these conditions could inform dietary approaches important for reducing age-related cognitive impairments and even late-life Alzheimer's disease, which develops over decades starting in mid-life.\"We started thinking about how cognitive impairments might start early on, particularly as people start to gain weight and become pre-diabetic,\" says Burton-Freeman, who has a Ph.D. in nutritional biology and did her post-doctoral work in internal medicine. She also worked previously in the biotech industry and as a research professor at the University of California before joining Illinois Tech in 2007 and launching the center in 2008.\"If these unique compounds in wild blueberries can improve inflammation status and metabolic disturbances, especially how insulin works in the main body, we would expect improved brain function,\" she says. \"Many people don't think about obesity or diabetes impacting their brain performance, but more and more we are finding they are linked.\"This wild blueberry study\u2014among 13 studies that Burton-Freeman and her fellow researchers will present at the Experimental Biology conference in Chicago this April\u2014observed metabolic and cognitive performance benefits among the participants.\"It's an exciting time for food and health research: People want to know more about their food. They want to know what food to eat and how it does what it claims. Consumers are listening, and they are demanding quality scientific evidence,\" says.Under the auspices of Illinois Tech's Institute for Food Safety and Health, the Clinical Nutrition Research Center conducts studies that aid in the development of food policy recommendations, including those for school lunch programs, and in the education of health professionals, agriculture groups, and government, some of which sponsor the center's studies. The center's location in Chicago offers access to a diverse pool of study participants, who receive more than good food and a paycheck for their services. \"One of the beauties of these studies is that people get to see how their bodies respond to different foods that they consume,\" says Britt Burton-Freeman, center director, about the health benefits of fruits and vegetables.The center studies a cornucopia of foods. Here are just a few of its findings during the past year:Their unique composition of fat and fiber may positively impact cardiovascular and metabolic health, and improve satiety, which can assist with obesity management.Believing that organic produce is superior to conventionally grown, low-income populations may avoid fresh produce altogether, indicating a need for better education and product labeling that emphasizes the importance of all produce as part of a healthy diet.Polyphenols, complex components in grape seeds, are antioxidants and improve blood pressure regulation for people with high blood pressure. Not all \"antioxidants\" or grape seed extracts are the same, so knowing the chemistry and structural activity relationship is an important part of the center's science.Eaten with a heavy meal, they helped to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body; berries eaten before the meal may work even better, preparing cells to manage the impending metabolic-oxidative inflammatory stress.

The paper was computer punch cards and the girl was Kim Erwin (M.Des. '94), whose father, Joseph, was on the biology faculty.\"I was absorbed by the patterns and textures created by the numbers and holes. Each card was different, and I used them as materials to build things or design art,\" says Erwin. One student, the late Barbara Herrington (DSGN '75), noticed her interest in the cards and invited Erwin to her room in Cunningham Hall to view models she had constructed for an Institute of Design course. \"I asked what design was and she described it as 'problem solving.' I was hooked,\" recalls Erwin. \"Barbara died young and suddenly, after a car accident, but not before convincing me that bold communication work can change how others experience new ideas.\"Erwin would go on to serve as a consumer innovation consultant for more than a decade, earn a degree from ID, and then join the ID faculty as a visiting professor in 2006 before being named assistant professor three years later. In 2016 she founded ID's Center for Collaborative Healthcare Design (CFCHD), where she directs the efforts of various multidisciplinary teams in conceptualizing and testing novel concepts in health care delivery and disease management. The CFCHD works on multi-institution grant-funded projects, including a six-year, $4.5 million National Institutes of Health-funded endeavor to improve outcomes for adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease.As a man of science, my father approached everything (including what was on our dinner plate) through systematic, analytic, and creative discussion. There's no doubt this influenced my interest and approach to ideas and problems. However, I also learned this is not always a successful approach to people.Much of what's driven my work is how to merge systems thinking around complex ideas with people-centered thinking about how to fit those ideas to our everyday lives. Healthcare is a great domain in which to engage this kind of thinking. In healthcare, there is exponentially more medical knowledge about effective treatments than is currently being delivered in clinical settings. People, not powerful ideas, are the X factor here. Applying design to health care, then, is about bridging great science to the people who need it by carefully examining and designing for the human behaviors into which any new idea must fit.I spent years in innovation consulting watching great work go unimplemented. This was work that was asked for, paid for, even enthusiastically received. And yet, too often nothing happened. And it turns out that this dynamic\u2014the great idea that can't seem to make it out of the room\u2014was an industry condition. We can all agree that not all ideas deserve to be implemented. Some fail because they should, because the timing is wrong or the organizational fit is weak. But that did not explain what I was seeing.What did explain this was realizing that we were unclear on the communication challenge of our work. Conventional practice relies on the power of the idea to drive action. I call this the Understanding Gap\u2014the belief that selling the ideas in all their richness, strategic potential, and connection to customers will naturally move an idea through to implementation. But It turns out that knowledge/exposure doesn't necessarily lead to action.What I learned is that the more common communication challenge is the Conviction Gap. The Conviction Gap is about believing that anything different needs to happen at all. Paychecks are getting cashed; the lights are still on\u2014so why rock the boat? The Conviction Gap is a different challenge. It requires selling the problem, not the solution. It is about building faith in the people who are telling the story, and building belief that the problem needs to be solved. From this conviction, you develop intuition about how to proceed \u2014 which way to approach each of the tens or hundreds of decisions along the way toward implementing a new idea. Conviction is also necessary because along the way some of the leaps are going to require the kind of courage that you can only have when you truly believe.Widely accepted studies show that more than 80 percent of the factors that influence a patient's health outcomes are outside the reach of clinical practice. People live, die, thrive, or suffer based on what happens in their homes, schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods, and depending on the choices they make as individuals. The current health care system, however, is almost entirely centered on that 20 percent of factors that happen within its four walls. And even in the clinical sphere, the vast majority of proven innovation in medicine does not make it into widespread practice. This is often because it's too hard for doctors, nurses, and insurers to adapt their behaviors and systems. Genetics and computation are driving ever smarter, more precise medicine. The challenge is how to get proven, effective solutions into clinical practice and into everyday contexts.The CFCHD's first healthcare project, the CHICAGO Plan, is a three-year, multi-institution comparative effectiveness trial aimed at reducing emergency department visits for kids with uncontrolled asthma. It has just now concluded, and we should have definitive data by June. Our role in that work was to perform user interviews both to inform the study design and to develop discharge instructions that people can actually read and use. Working with the CHICAGO Plan research team, we designed a new discharge tool that promotes best practice asthma guidelines in a form that helps ED staff deliver consistent and accurate instruction using language that average people can understand. This new tool won a national design award and was tested at six hospitals on Chicago's south and west sides.ID's graduate students are heavily involved in moving our health care work forward. They already seek opportunities that make a difference, so the work is well aligned with many students' personal missions. What's great about having these grants in-house is that I can also use them to teach both the theories and methods behind design fieldwork and analysis. And because there are real people being impacted, not imaginary \"personas,\" we are inculcating the highest standards of ethics and rigor. So it's a win-win.One example is an NIH-funded grant to help people living with sickle-cell anemia get the care that they need. Students will be doing observational studies in emergency rooms, primary care settings and patient's homes to understand current practice. Students get to work on a project with substance and meaning, while receiving mentorship and guidance from me and other faculty. People with sickle cell, who are often living in difficult conditions, are more likely to be candid with our students and share things with them that they would not share with doctors, nurses, or more conventional medical researchers. Similarly, clinical staff are more likely to open up to us than to their medical colleagues. We are (and are viewed as) neutral listeners."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2017/taking-science-and-fiction-extremes", "content": "As a child Joanne Gucwa (CHEM '68) was interested in how things work. Whether she was listening to her father's crystal radio set to pick up local broadcasts or exploring her grandparents' farm in southern Illinois, Gucwa continuously learned from the world around her. Today, as she continues a longstanding career as an industrial management consultant, Gucwa melds a wealth of knowledge with her love of nature to write science-based fiction books for children.Melody and Mallory Maloney are the 7-year-old twin protagonists of Gucwa's 12-book series,. As the sister and brother explore a variety of United States locales during travels with their parents and grandfather, they each discover their \"extremophile\" abilities and impart science lessons to readers.The extremophile concept in the stories arose out of Gucwa's Bioblog, which she developed in the late 1990s. Through the blog she shared practical, tech-based articles with readers via brief summaries and links, and soon discovered that the articles that generated the most reader interest covered extremophiles, organisms that thrive in physically or geochemically extreme conditions.

Johnson Polymer Professor Fouad Teymour, director of Illinois Tech's, and Papavasiliou's doctoral thesis advisor, recalls her initiative and determination early on.\"What is impressive is that she would never need to perform these experiments herself in the future as an assistant professor, yet she understood instinctively that in order to mentor and supervise students who perform those tasks, she must have experienced them on her own first,\" he says. \"I admire this approach to mentorship, where the mentor subjects herself a priori to the same environment the student will have to perform in.\"\"After being in Professor Papavasiliou's lab, I realize that there are a lot of health problems that are not so easily seen but are no less important.\"\u2014Merjem Mededovic (BME 3rd year)The current graduate students who Papavasiliou mentors are working with her, Teymour, and University of Chicago professor and gastrointestinal surgeon John Alverdy on a National Institutes of Health-funded project that focuses on post-surgical intestinal healing following colorectal anastomosis, the point of connection where a surgeon reattaches two sections of an intestine that has been severed for, say, the removal of a tumor. In nearly a quarter of such surgeries the anastomoses break down, causing the contents of the intestine to leak out, resulting in infections, post-surgical complications, and in some cases, death. The Illinois Tech team is exploring ways to transport potentially life-saving drugs to the site of the leak via an innovative nanoparticle system that it has developed. Nanoparticle systems can offer the advantage of highly stable drug delivery at the molecular level through various routes of administration.\"An oral formulation would be rapidly cleared from the kidneys and rapidly absorbed, so we need an approach to localize these compounds and provide sustained release for prolonged periods of time,\" says Papavasiliou.Merjem Mededovic (BME 3rd year) has had opportunities to work in Papavasiliou's lab on other projects both as a volunteer and through the(PURE). Now in her second semester as a PURE student, she is one member of a team working on a research project funded through the American Heart Association. The group is exploring novel ways, through the use of nanoparticles and hydrogel scaffolds, to deliver substances that will stimulate the formation of new blood vessels for the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disease. Mededovic says that the lab's tiered mentoring system and focus on innovative work to develop polymeric biomaterials for applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery have provided her with a whole new way of learning in addition to her coursework, as well as a new career direction.A native of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mededovic considered becoming either a physician or prosthetic biomedical engineer after witnessing firsthand the many individuals whose lives had been impacted by civil war in her homeland. She is now considering a graduate program in biomedical engineering capped by an M.B.A. so that she can pursue leadership opportunities in the drug-delivery industry.\"After being in Professor Papavasiliou's lab, I realize that there are a lot of health problems that are not so easily seen but are no less important,\" Mededovic says, noting that the intimate \"group mentoring\" experience in the lab is helping her discover new skillsets and other ways she can contribute to making a difference in the world. She plans to stay in Papavasiliou's lab until she graduates and is especially looking forward to this summer and an external internship that Papavasiliou is helping to arrange to further broaden her research scope.Whether counseling students after hours or seeking tailored learning opportunities for them to expand upon their developing interests, Papavasiliou sees it all as part of her students-first mindset. Mededovic has become a mentor to local high school students through Illinois Tech's. Papavasiliou has been recognized as an outstanding teacher two times, first as a teaching assistant during her doctoral studies, earning the W. M.

However, unlike a na\u00efve daydreamer out of touch with reality, Ren has both feet firmly planted on the ground, especially when it comes to the evolving concept of cloud computing. A network security researcher, Ren received a 2011 Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation for his proposal \"Secure and Privacy-Assured Data Service Outsourcing in Cloud Computing\" and will receive $498,679 for five years, slated to begin this summer.Cloud computing is envisioned as a centralized network resource functioning as a public utility, much like gas or water. Service is provided on demand with clients paying only for what they use. Using the metaphor of a cloud for the Internet, this form of computing draws upon the knowledge that any computer connected online can store and access personal files, play games, and perform word processing on a remote cloud server instead of an individualized drive or corporate server. The popular Web-based Google Gmail is an example of a cloud-computing service.Ren says that the convenience and elastic nature of cloud computing are very attractive, not to mention the reduction in capital cost commitments for hardware and software. The cloud has also captured national executive-level attention. This February, the United States Chief Information Office issued a report estimating that $20 billion of the federal government's $80 billion budget for information technology is targeted for potential cloud computing solutions. As promising as this form of computing can be, there is a dark cloud on the horizon, which Ren hopes he can help to dissipate.\"Suddenly, the cloud is a third party,\" he says. \"Data is physically located in the cloud and service is physically provided by the cloud. This brings a lot of unique privacy and security challenges, particularly in data service outsourcing\u2014storage issues, search issues, and access-control issues. Because the actual data owner is not the physical data controller, it creates problems.\"Ren says that even established firms like Google lose cloud-computing data, citing an incident this March where around 150,000 Gmail accounts disappeared. He and his team of graduate students plan a three-pronged approach to minimize risks in the commercial public cloud through the creation of an encrypted cloud data service, a scalable and owner-controlled cloud data-sharing service, and a privacy-preserving secure cloud-storage system. They will conduct their research at the Ubiquitous Security and Privacy Research Laboratory Ren directs at IIT and on the Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\"I have always been fascinated by how the Internet could affect people's lives,\" says Ren. \"Cloud computing could enable services that have never before been utilized.

His single father, a recent Romanian immigrant, thought his son would fare better being raised by a loving family, so he took Olin to live with his sister and her husband in the East European Republic of Moldova. In 1940, the former Soviet Union occupied the Moldova region and confiscated the small shoe store his family owned. One year later, Olin and his aunt were exiled to a tiny farming village in a remote part of Siberia, while his uncle was sent separately to an undisclosed labor camp somewhere in the Ural Mountains.As an 11-year-old newcomer to farm life, Olin was required to perform unfamiliar duties such as herding sheep, tending the small family plot to raise potatoes and other vegetables, and bringing water from the river. He transported the water by balancing two buckets on a wooden yoke across his shoulders for the half-mile trip home.Police required families that were exiled to Siberia to remain there for a minimum of 20 years. Leaving without permission was impossible since the area was surrounded by quicksand marshes and access was by a river that the police patrolled. After nearly three years under these conditions, Olin and his aunt were granted a travel permit to go to Uzbekistan, where he resumed the education that was not available to him in Siberia. Permission was granted only after intervention by the United States Department of State because Olin was an American citizen.In Uzbekistan, Olin advanced rapidly in his academics and excelled in his English lessons. In 1946, after much diplomatic entreaty, he rejoined his father in Chicago and finished his secondary education at the famous Bronx High School of Science.Olin went on to pursue a distinguished career in architecture, promoting standards of quality in design and construction, energy efficiency, and environmental planning as essential means of improving residential developments across the country. He also served as managing deputy building commissioner for the City of Chicago, where he guided the comprehensive revision of the Chicago Building Code. A fellow of the American Institute of Architects, Olin is principal author of Olin's Construction: Principles, Materials, and Methods, an educational industry text that has been in continuous publication and in use since 1964.Although the relationship Olin and his father shared may have been separated by geographic distance for most of his life, Olin says that in addition to the treasured flag, his father also left him with a sense of mission he carried forward his entire life in this country.\"I can remember that every time I saw my father he would say, 'So, what did you accomplish today? Did you make a difference?'\" says Olin. \"I don't know that I succeeded every time, but he embedded that belief within me to this day.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/slideshow-stroll-summer-day", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/pavements-sky", "content": "\"Many people thought that 9/11 would be the death of tall buildings, but actually, what has happened in the last 10 years has been unprecedented in the number, size, and type of tall buildings that have been erected,\" says Antony Wood, executive director of the IIT-basedand a studio associate professor at IIT College of Architecture. \"Almost every major city in the world has been developing tall buildings. That's never happened before.\"As if to punctuate his statement, the Chicago firm of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture announced in August that it is designing what will be the world's next tallest building,, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Smith also helped to design the current record-holder while he was at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP--in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which opened in 2010. The Burj is as tall as Chicago's John Hancock Center atop Willis Tower, the tallest building in the western hemisphere.Wood transitioned into academia from his career as an architect on September 11, 2001. The day's tragic circumstances inspired him to further hison how tall buildings can relate to their unique environment and evolve to meet the challenges of the future, one being rapidly increasing urbanization.\"As a global species, we need to build a new city of a million people every week,\" he says, citing United Nations statistics indicating that 200,000 people emigrate from rural to urban settings daily worldwide. One way to address this influx is to build vertically and maximize opportunities for social and commercial interaction through the use of horizontal connections-skybridges-between complexes that comprise multiple tall buildings. Skybridges can also provide an alternative escape route in the event of emergency.\"In normal usage, the skybridge enables sharing of space within the towers; in an emergency situation in one tower, the people in the top half don't have to evacuate to the ground level but can exit halfway along into the safe tower and use the elevator there,\" he explains.Wood acknowledges, however, that even skybridges would not have made an appreciable difference in saving lives in a fuel-intensive and impact-heavy scenario like 9/11.\"When one looks at the extent of the trauma that the buildings experienced, it's absolutely incredible that they stayed standing for a period of time at all,\" he says. \"So many lessons have been learned since then. 9/11 was projected into the conscience of people throughout the world like no other incident ever has. It focused much attention on the typology of tall buildings, which ultimately, has contributed to their success in the decade since then.\"Antony Wood says that since 9/11, tall building safety research has been focused primarily on three areas: improvements to structural systems, fire protection, and evacuation procedures. One change that has been occurring even before 9/11-substituting concrete-and-steel acting together compositely rather than steel alone as the primary building material-has improved other aspects of building performance.\"Concrete-encased steel gives better structural performance and solves the fire protection problem,\" he says, noting that the gypsum-based fireproofing sprayed onto the interior supports of the World Trade Center came off when the planes struck the towers.\"When the fire occurred,\" says Wood, \"it weakened the exposed steel and ultimately, led to the collapse of the buildings.\"Some improvements include:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/green-lean-and-clean", "content": ", one of Earth's first organisms-algae-enabled the evolution of higher life forms by converting water and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen. Today, as fossil fuel sources are dwindling, researchers are looking to these simple progenitors as a key element in the survival of the human race.Cynthia \"C. J.\" Warner (M.B.A. '87) so believes that algae fuel can be a direct replacement for fossil fuel that she traded her nearly 30-year career in Big Oil to join a startup with a big vision: to change the world by developing a domestic, renewable source of energy that benefits the environment and hastens America's energy independence.\"I feel strongly that we need to start working now to develop good and viable alternatives to crude, or face the inevitable crisis of major crude oil shortages,\" says Warner from the San Diego headquarters of Sapphire Energy, Inc., a pioneer in the algae-as-biofuel movement. \"The energy market is so large that alternative supplies need to be very well developed before they make much difference at all, and developing such significant volumes of truly viable substitutes takes time. That's why I am now devoting all of my own attention to developing Green Crude-a sustainable, low-carbon, scalable substitute for crude oil,\" she explains.On the top 10 list in Biofuels Digest's \"The 50 Hottest Companies in Bioenergy for 2010\u20132011,\" Sapphire Energy has been drawing attention since its founding in 2007. The following year, the company produced the world's first batch of 91-octane fuel made from a renewable source. In a 2009 test run, Green Crude was used in a biofuel-traditional fuel blend to power a Continental Airlines 737 jet, yielding a 1.1 percent increase in fuel efficiency and a 60\u201380 percent emissions reduction over traditional jet fuel.The United States Department of Energy first explored the use of algae as a fossil-fuel alternative after the oil crisis of the 1970s. During that period, Warner was a chemical engineering major at Vanderbilt University and completing a summer internship at the Amoco Research Center (where she met her husband, Dave [ME '90]), not far from her hometown of Glen Ellyn, Ill. While industry was searching for new fuel options and processing techniques, society was becoming increasingly aware of its role as environmental steward.\"Coupling these very meaningful challenges with the technological innovation required to address them made for an irresistible combination,\" she says. \"I was hooked and ready to become part of the energy solution.\"Warner began working at Des Plaines, Ill.-based UOP LLC before moving on to the Amoco Corporation and British Petroleum, advancing in key operational leadership positions. Her industry achievements here and abroad include turning around BP's U.S. refining business and developing long-term technology strategies for low-carbon and sustainable fuels. Warner was tapped for the role of Sapphire Energy president while she was living in London, serving as BP's group vice president for global refining.\"C. J. brought world-class industrial discipline to Sapphire,\" says Stephen Mayfield, a Sapphire Energy co-founder and director of the San Diego Center for Algae Biotechnology. \"That does not mean rigid or unimaginative; in fact, it means just the opposite. It means an ability to integrate a variety of scientific disciplines including biology, engineering, chemistry, and economics into an efficient production process. A person who can do that is hard to find, but C. J. is that person.\"The company has a test and demonstration site in Las Cruces, N.M., where algae strains are developed, and is building an Integrated Algal Biorefinery near Columbus, N.M., projected to be complete in 2012. The refinery, which will have an output of 100 barrels of Green Crude per day, will show how algal oil can be produced on a continuous commercial scale and refined into Jet A and diesel fuels, and petroleum. By 2015, the company expects to be cost-competitive with $75-per-barrel crude.\"Replacing liquid transportation fuels is arguably one of the greatest challenges facing our nation today. It took us hundreds of years to move from wood to whale oil, and 100 more to shift from whale oil to crude oil,\" says Warner. \"Unfortunately, we don't have another 100 years.

A trumpeter steps toward the edge of the stage and delivers an impassioned solo, the notes now intimately entangled, now isolated in staccato flashes. Drinking it all in with apparent delight, Dan Love (EE '51) is in his element, playing host to a captivated audience at Steamers, Southern California's premier jazz club.Cool cat and jazz impresario may seem improbable roles for the nearly 80-year-old IIT alumnus, whose career in electrical engineering has earned him almost every honor the field affords, as well as taken him around the world. Such eclecticism seems to serve him well, however; he hasn't missed a beat since earning his degree at IIT in 1951.Love was born in Fall River, Mass., in 1928. The son of a career Navy man, he enjoyed a carefree childhood, describing himself as a somewhat indifferent high school student. There wasn't much to do in the declining textile mill center, though every now and then someone exciting would blow into town, as when legendary performer Cab Calloway showed up to dazzle the locals.Things changed around the time Love turned 15, when momentous events set his life on a more serious track. Love vividly recalls the occasion: \"I was traveling to my aunt and uncle's in Rhode Island when I heard the news on the car radio that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor,\" he says. Love was apprehensive, as his father had already been called back into the Navy.Three years later, with America's war seething in the Pacific, he followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the Navy. He left aboard an attack cargo craft, the USS Hydrus, passing in stages through Pearl Harbor and the Solomon Islands to Guadalcanal, where the ship anchored.During landing operations on Okinawa, Love witnessed the notorious kamikaze pilots. Fortunately, he survived the ordeal, taking part a few months later in Operation Magic Carpet, the massive effort to return American troops to the United States at war's end.Returning to the States was tough at first. Dan found himself with few inspiring job prospects and decided it was time to get serious about his studies. At IIT, he found a mentor in one of his early professors, Eric T. B. Gross\u2014a pioneering engineer and engineering educator\u2014who saw great promise in the young man.As Love's adviser, Gross taught him the value of hard work and motivated his young disciple toward excellence. In return, Gross found a worthy and appreciative prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Love. \"It was inspirational that someone was interested in me. He always encouraged me to do something enriching,\" Love remembers.It was during these formative school days, between lectures and cramming for math and physics exams, that Love was seriously drawn to jazz, a flirtation that soon turned into an abiding passion. \"In the dorm, I was exposed to many cultures: Americans from many parts of the country and people from South America, Turkey, Africa, Europe, and Asia. I didn't own a radio, but I heard others play music from jazz to classics to pop tunes. I often attended concerts in Grant Park.\"The improvisational daring and creativity of jazz offered a respite from the rigors of his engineering coursework and an occasional break from the engineering crowd, \"a pretty straight-laced bunch,\" Love recalls with a laugh. Whatever the case, he soon became immersed in the music of such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Stan Getz, and the Brazilian master Antonio Carlos Jobim, the prolific composer of \"Girl From Ipanema\" and other classics.Love passed his affinity for jazz to his son Terence, who took up the tenor sax and would later openin 1994. This regional oasis for musicians and aficionados alike\u2014the L.A. Times praised, \"Steamers hosts the who's who of Los Angeles jazz\"\u2014eventually proved an irresistible attraction for Dan. He joined in the enterprise to help with logistics and, of course, to soak up all the free jazz.Dan also hosts the popular Monday night event featuring big band music. Helping jazz lovers find the best seats to take in the evening's sets and overseeing the business of running a successful club may seem a long way from Love's early days as a study-worn engineering geek. Looking back, he recalls that after graduation, he found a job in a Chicago steel mill, where his intuitive talents in the field made an early impression.Working in a roundhouse that serviced diesel locomotives, Love encountered one of his first real-life engineering conundrums. A compressor had been malfunctioning, and, as test engineer, he was asked to identify the problem. Easier said than done, as a number of senior members, including the shop foreman who'd been on the job 25 years, had applied their talents, to little avail. Love found a neglected schematic taped to the wall and recognized that the diagram didn't match the compressor's configuration: a resistor was missing, yielding improper starting current when he measured the circuit with an ammeter. Once the missing piece was inserted, the long-vexing problem was solved. Love prepared a paper on this engineering riddle for Power Magazine.It was a nice break for a fresh grad. Love's problem-solving talents grew as he migrated to the specialization of forensic engineering\u2014an investigation of material failures or malfunctions, often involving criminal liability. Immersion in this then-unfamiliar discipline made Love an authority on engineering safety. Eventually, he applied his expertise to the oversight of fossil and nuclear power plants, work that would take him around the world, including an extended stint in Spain as an employee for Bechtel.With his company, Love Consulting, Dan has conducted countless investigations. In addition to probing engineering complexities, the work often involves delicate legal maneuverings to assess responsibility. \"It's really a mind game to determine what happened,\" he says.Despite his semi-retirement, Love's science affiliations haven't been entirely replaced by the bohemian allure of the California jazz community. This summer, Love will act as a jury member for nominees to theprogram, the most coveted honor in the field. Love was made a fellow in 1987 and looks forward to the challenge of helping to select this year's inductees. He is clearly proud of his standing among the field's elite: \"To become a fellow is to have made significant accomplishments and to be one of less than 0.1 percent selected annually for membership elevation.\"When queried on the career prospects for students contemplating the world of electrical engineering, Love's enthusiasm was palpable. \"There's just so much activity in the field today, in communications, sensing, computers, entertainment, power\u2026.I wish I were young and just entering engineering now!\" Should you need more inspiration than that, drop by the club when you're in the neighborhood. Your host will give you an earful about the distinctive rewards of music and science and the gratification that comes from living a vibrant life (that is, if he finds a spare minute!)."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2005/big-things-small-packages", "content": "You don't need to be a physicist to be engaged by. Perhaps that's because White is able to explain the most complex of scientific concepts in the simplest of terms and to turn physics into something that is not only accessible to lay people but exciting to them.So how does White define physics? \"Physicists take the world and explain it using mathematics,\" he says. \"We study the most fundamental constituents of matter. There's the protons, the neutrons, the electrons, and the photons. And those four particles are all that's required to explain the world. So everything from DNA to panda bears to modern buildings can be broken down into these four things. It's nature at its most fundamental.\"White's research focus is on the neutrino, or 'little neutral one,' one of the smallest particles of matter. Scientists are currently hypothesizing that the neutrino is responsible for everything from the evolution of the galaxy to continental drift. But the neutrino wasn't always so popular.The concept of the neutrino was first proposed in the early 1900s by theoretical physicistto explain the mysterious disappearance of energy that was observed when a neutron falls apart into a proton and electron.Pauli theorized that a new particle was created with this energy, but he was so ashamed of his unproven idea, he bowed out of the conference at which he should have introduced the neutrino to the public. (He said that he had to attend a town dance and therefore couldn't make it.) So the neutrino remained unsung until the 1950s, when solid proof of its existence was discovered via a nuclear reactor.Still, neutrinos didn't seem all that interesting at first. Scientists thought they were massless and didn't interact with other particles. (It turns out that particles of matter communicate with each other all the time, kind of like the way we speak through soundwaves.) \"There are certain ways that particles can talk to each other to say, 'Hey, I'm here,'\" says White. For example, photons communicate via electromagnetic attraction, and quarks via what physicists call the 'strong interaction,' which is what keeps the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom bonded together. The photons are the social butterflies of the universe\u2014those at the core of the sun have to walk their way out to the surface a few centimeters at a time, and it takes them thousands of years because they keep running into something they want to talk to.Not so the neutrino. According to White, \"The neutrinos that are created at the center of the sun and bang, they're gone. If you could make something as dense as the Earth and line it up the entire length of the solar system, the neutrino would pass right through it. It simply does not interact with other particles of matter. That's why the neutrino has been described as the loner of the elementary particles.So why should we care about little particles that don't play well with others and are massless? \"Because the neutrino makes the short list of fundamental particles of which our entire universe is composed, so it's worthwhile to figure out the rules by which it works,\" responds White. \"If you understand the fundamental building blocks, then you should be able to work your way up and understand how everything else works.\"And it turns out we may not know as much about the neutrino as we thought. For starters, it may have mass after all. Every time scientists tried to measure neutrinos, they ended up with far fewer of them than they had anticipated. Where did all those missing neutrinos go? The answer is in their flavor. It turns out that neutrinos seem to oscillate, which means they can essentially change their identity. Neutrinos come in three flavors: electron, muon, and tau. An electron neutrino, though it may be born an electron neutrino, can decide one day it wants to be a muon or a tau neutrino. And according to the laws of quantum mechanics, only particles that have mass can shift from one state to another like this.\"Now, this may not sound all that crazy,\" says White. \"But to give you a sense of how radical it is within particle physics, it would be equivalent to humans saying they're going to change their gender overnight. Yes, some do, but they generally need a little more help. And that's the best part of being a scientist, when all of a sudden something that you had no idea was there is found. And that's what's happening right now with neutrino physics.\"White is among a group of physicists who are redefining the way we think about the neutrino. He is currently a member of the(MINOS) project at, a high-energy physics research center in Illinois. The project, which got off the ground earlier this year, involves shooting a beam of neutrinos from Fermilab toward an abandoned iron mine in northern Minnesota, where a giant detector is installed a half mile beneath the earth. Why Minnesota? It turns out that in order for neutrinos to oscillate, to morph from one flavor to another, they need to travel a particular distance, which is approximately that from Chicago to Minnesota.On its way to Minnesota, the neutrino beam has to go under the Earth's surface due to its curvature (as well as under a few thousand people, but don't worry about them\u2014every cubic yard surrounding us already contains trillions of the little guys). Going underground also avoids most of the radiation coming into the earth from space, which might cause interactions unrelated to the experiment.Since neutrinos are loners, only a tiny fraction of the neutrinos will actually interact in the MINOS detector. The vast majority\u2014more than 99.99 percent\u2014of all the neutrinos created at Fermilab just shoot off into space. \"We're producing trillions of neutrinos every two to three seconds. Our hope is that, each day, one will stop in Minnesota and say hi to us,\" says White. \"We're actually looking for the disappearance of muon neutrinos and the appearance of electron neutrinos, so we count how many muon neutrinos we send, and then how many we see at the other end.\"In reality, they're not actually observing the neutrinos themselves at all, but the products of their interactions with other particles. The different types of neutrinos leave behind different products marking their interactions\u2014an electron neutrino leaves behind an electron, a tau neutrino leaves behind a tau, you get the idea. Depending on funding, the project will continue for at least five years.The type of basic science in which White and his colleagues engage may not have immediate consequences for our daily lives, but its potential to help reveal clues about the nature of the universe is invaluable.\"As a society, we have decided that an understanding of the world in which we live is critical, not necessarily because it's going to give us better televisions\u2014though eventually down the line it probably will\u2014but because we feel some things have intrinsic value, such as art and knowledge. I like to put this in that category.\"Chris White is an associate professor ofand has worked at IIT since 1995. He's taught everything from general physics to upper level courses such as Subatomic Physics, Astrophysics, and Electronics. An electronics lab manual he coauthored with fellow professoris even used in physics classes at IIT. In 2003, White received the Excellence in Teaching award, which is given to just one faculty member each year based on peer and student recommendations. He's also, or rather, he has dressed up as Einstein for bothand Fermilab as part of his numerous 'physics outreach>'\u00a0functions. White actively involves his IIT students in physics demonstrations that educate the public, and he visits area high schools and his local grade school to discuss science with students.Although he grew up interested in astronomy, White became attracted to particle physics in high school and has been fascinated by it ever since. White notes the connection between the two fields: \"The thing that's so interesting is that there's this connection of the study of the smallest with the study of the largest, which is cosmology. The smallest are these individual pieces, and the largest is the universe, and the understanding of the universe as a whole is critically dependent on our understanding of what's happening at the smallest scales.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2006/students-rally-bog", "content": "First it was built on Ogden Bog, then it was \"The Bog,\" then it became storage space for emergency water (which, when the water spilled out of its boxes and flooded the floor of Hermann Hall\u2014the HUB\u2014made it a bit of a bog again). Not surprisingly, it's The Bog\u2014the former student and faculty hangout in the basement of HUB, closed for the past three years\u2014that a group of current IIT students has successfully campaigned to reinstall, this time for good. The Bog, which featured a bowling alley, bar, and recreation center, was open for four decades. Thousands of alumni and faculty enjoyed the facility and have passed down their many fond memories and stories through the years. These stories helped to fuel the students' desire to bring back The Bog.Already interested in expanding entertainment options on campus, a handful of student-leaders attended a conference seminar last year on how to ignite a passionate student body, and \"It all came together,\" says Jason Tenenbaum (AE, 4th year),(SGA) president.Adds Tim Schug (CE, 5th year), \"Our takeaway from the speaker was 'make an impact, an impact, an impact.'\"\"We realized The Bog was something nearly everyone missed, even if we hadn't experienced it as students,\" \u2014jason\u00a0TenenbaumUpon their return, the students began doing their homework. They surveyed fellow classmates about life on campus and how frequently they would use The Bog. At least 600 students participated in Strike Force Bowling Society events last year, and students were itching for both more consistent event programming and more options to gather outside the classroom. \"We realized The Bog was something nearly everyone missed, even if we hadn't experienced it as students,\" Tenenbaum says.After conducting a feasibility assessment and learning that many faculty and administrators were also behind their efforts, SGA committed student activities fund money to assist with the operation of The Bog.But they still had to bring it back to life.Over the summer, Tenenbaum, Schug, Strike Force President Brandon Lloyd (AE, 4th year), and Union Board President Vishal Kadakia (BME, 4th year) continued their campaign to bring back The Bog. A few years of neglect had left the space in need of significant renovation. Just some of the work to be done included installing a new sprinkler system and new electronic scoring, replacing old floor tiles, rehabilitating lanes, pinsetters, and kitchen equipment, and buying new bowling balls and shoes. \"It was a big budget we were asking for. At one point we thought we'd have to count on alumni and others for $800,000 to make it happen. Even if we did raise the money, we weren't sure we'd get to enjoy The Bog before we graduated,\" says Schug.Eventually their vision, determination, and energy paid off. In July, President Lew Collens approved the proposal, but asked the students to help raise $400,000 in philanthropy to offset the renovation costs.Among many impressed by the students in action was Steve Lindee of Institutional Advancement. \"This is about a spirit, not a place,\" he says. \"These students want a piece of university heritage they can hang on to. Something's come alive here, and alumni, faculty, and staff are getting caught up in it. It's a fever we hope everyone catches.\"As work begins this fall, everyone in the IIT community has an opportunity to help the effort. \"We got the ball rolling,\" says Tenenbaum, \"but now we hope everyone gets involved. People can offset some of the renovation costs, they can visit The Bog, and they can share their stories. Students could give $10 and still make a big impact.\"This year during Homecoming and Alumnifest (October 6\u20138), the students are hoping to show off the renovation progress being made as new life is breathed back into the campus hangout, which is anticipated to open this winter.\"Homecoming will be great; we'll see some progress by then,\" says Schug. \"But we can't wait for January.\"To learn more about how you can help support the work the students have started and to share your favorite Bog and campus life memories, visitor email."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2005/man-mars", "content": "On the evening of July 4, 1997, Jacob Matijevic (MATH '69) waited along with the rest of the world for the Mars rover called Sojourner to exit the Pathfinder lander and begin its exploration of the red planet. This new era of U.S. space exploration was, for Matijevic, not only an historic event, but also a critical moment in his career\u2014a culmination of decades of work and study. Matijevic remembers, \"It was a hectic two days of commanding the rover to drive down Pathfinder's ramp. By approximately midnight PDT on July 5, we received confirming images that the rover was on Mars.\" It had been a long ride, but Matijevic and Sojourner had finally arrived.\"That was one of the happiest days of my life,\" says Matijevic. \"It was a fitting end to nearly five years of struggle to develop, test, and operate this new space system and a great reward for the efforts of a team of dedicated engineers.\"Matijevic had become intrigued with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space program, specifically the Voyager missions, while teaching mathematics at the University of Southern California. Twin Voyagers 1 and 2, which launched in 1977, began an extensive tour of the outer solar system by visiting Jupiter and Saturn before being propelled further. Still sending signals back to Earth, they remain the farthest human-created objects to travel from Earth and are on target to be the first spacecraft to leave the confines of our heliosphere\u2014an immense magnetic bubble containing our solar system, solar wind, and the entire solar magnetic field. Matijevic followed Voyager's discoveries closely, and in 1981 his interest led him to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL), where he currently works in operations as the Mars Exploration Rover Engineering Team chief.Over the course of its existence, NASA has pursued new ways to increase the level of detail gleaned from its planetary missions. The rover has extended the capacity of knowledge gained from unmanned explorations. 'Rover' is a general term used to describe a thinking robot on wheels with cameras that serve as its eyes. They travel inside landers, spacecraft that land on the surface of another planet and are capable of collecting data, but that remain stationary after landing. Rovers are programmed to run on autopilot and to react to unexpected activity or planetary terrain. Information obtained by the rover is transmitted to the lander, which stores and sends messages in between the rover and a NASA operator.Matijevic says that while design concepts for rovers can be prototyped relatively easily, it is only through rigid testing of these prototypes that engineers are able to identify problems prior to implementation.\"Testing the capability of these vehicles to engage and then drive over obstacles illustrates the geometric and dynamic limitations of the rover's design,\" he says. \"When possible, I like to include testing in a variety of terrains. There are many situations presented to a vehicle in these tests that cannot be fully replicated in a sandbox.\"Matijevic began working with robotics at JPL following the missions of NASA's Viking 1 and 2, which were the first successful landers to study Mars, in 1976 and 1982. After years of working on advanced mission concepts and technology development, Matijevic joined the first flight demonstrator project and helped to create Sojourner. Sojourner weighed only 23 pounds and explored about 750 square feet of Martian surface, collecting 16,500 images from the lander's camera. Today, Sojourner is still on the surface of Mars waiting to be retrieved. Opportunity and Spirit followed, deployed in January 2004. The rovers continue to send back exciting new details about Mars; as of press date, Spirit had driven 3.07 miles and Opportunity 3.65 miles.In August 2005, NASA launched its most recent exploratory effort, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The craft is on schedule to arrive in the Martian orbit in March 2006, when it will use cameras to take extreme close-up photography of the Martian surface, carry a sounder to find subsurface water, and look for safe and scientifically worthy sites for future rover exploration.With new glimpses of Mars and prospective missions to the planet shaping his day-to-day life, Matijevic sees the galaxy through a lens into which the rest of us could only hope to view. Still, he says, one discovery would trump them all: \"Hopefully these future missions will discover evidence that can determine whether there had been past life on Mars. That's the one space exploration achievement I'd like to see in my lifetime.'Almost a decade after its historic trip on the surface of Mars, Sojourner received national recognition, along with three other robots, when they were all welcomed into the Robot Hall of Fame. At Carnegie Hall on November 10, 2003, the First Annual Induction Ceremony honored the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner Rover; the first industrial robot, Unimate, developed in 1961, which worked with heated die-casting machines on the assembly line at a General Motors plant; and two movie stars: R2-D2 of Star Wars and HAL 9000, a central character in the Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey.Sojourner began its journey on Pathfinder seven months prior to its Mars landing- traveling 119 million miles from Earth to its destiny. Moments before reaching the surface, Pathfinder released its air bags in preparation for impact. Around NASA, it has been said that the accomplishment of landing the Pathfinder was like playing a par-four hole of golf, teeing off in California and aiming for a four-inch, moving hole in Texas. According to the space mission log, the rover's primary goals were scheduled to occur within the first seven 'Martian days' and all within about 30 feet of the lander. The extended mission included additional analyses of nearby rock and soil and more tests of the rover's capabilities."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2005/iit-2010-interview-president-lew-collens", "content": "Outside, it's an idyllic summer day in Chicago. Inside the office of IIT President Lew Collens, more than the good weather is providing the energy. Tonight, a gala will signal the much-anticipated unveiling of the newly restored. It's also the first day of classes, which has Collens particularly excited.\"IIT is a great place. I just walked through the campus center, and it's humming and alive with students. I just love it,\" says Collens.This is an important time for Collens' and for the university. As he begins his 16th year as president, he is leading IIT in a critical self-study spurred by the North Central Association Committee re-accreditation process, which measures the effectiveness of universities at meeting their goals. Simultaneously, he is spearheading the creation of the 2010 Plan, which will define IIT's academic priorities for the coming half-decade.Collens shares with IIT Magazine the details surrounding the re-accreditation, the progress of the 2010 Plan, and his outlook on the future of IIT.Our successes in the past decade can be traced to thefor IIT, which was created in 1994 to look at the future of the university. What came out of that process were several key things. One was the creation of our(IPRO) program, which today is the cornerstone of our academic approach.The second was the decision to rebuild IIT's campus and to be a strong force in rebuilding the neighborhood. By all measures that has been a dramatic success. We have had great support from the city and the state. We still have a lot of work to do. We have just completed an important renovation of Crown Hall, and Wishnick Hall and undergraduate labs across campus are in the midst of major transformations.But the most important success is the quality of our students, faculty, and educational programs. At the undergraduate level, we have had a remarkable increase in the quality of our students as measured by SAT and ACT scores. We have done very well in faculty recruiting, and are fortunate to have so many faculty members who are great teachers, scholars, and researchers.In the past decade thehas led a dramatic expansion in all of the life sciences. We were able to transfer the ownership ofto its employees, enhancing they're well being as well as the university endowment. We also should take pride in the quality of our Board of Trustees and the great work they continue to do, including leadership that has brought several hundred million in philanthropy to the university.To make sure to think broadly and creatively, to acknowledge weaknesses, and to understand what we need to do better and what we can do better. The commission challenged the institution with the idea of the IPRO program. We knew it was a very difficult thing to do. The faculty rose to the occasion, and it worked. What's important is that we challenged ourselves.The 2010 Plan is the umbrella for defining IIT's strategic initiatives, and it is being done in conjunction with the re-accreditation process. With re-accreditation, we analyze for the committee all aspects of the university: our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. They don't tell us what kind of school to be. They ask us to define the kind of school that we want to be, and ask us what kind of school we are telling the world we are. Think of it as a truth in disclosure.It is important to note that we are in the early stages of planning and the university community has not yet come to a decision on the priorities for the next five years. Whatever emerges from the planning process, there is one constant: We are committed to providing a high-quality educational experience for our exceptional students. During the past several years we have developed several areas that have the potential to greatly impact the institution in terms of reputation, resource enhancement, and research.We have invested heavily in the life sciences to ensure that the university is well positioned in this area of primary importance to economic and social development in the years ahead.We have invested heavily in creating one of the best undergraduate programs in the nation. Our interprofessional,, and leadership program provide our students with a distinctive opportunity for education and personal growth.We are an excellent university, but we live in a very competitive environment. The students we want are among the best in the world. So we have to work hard to continue to enhance our reputation to enable us to recruit the best students. The same is true with regard to faculty. There are nearly 4,000 colleges and universities in the United States. We are easily in the top 2 percent, but within that 2 percent it's a whole different competitive experience. A strong faculty, diverse student body, and quality overall resources will allow us to continue to stand out.Academically, we will be one of the national leaders in the commercialization of life science research and have significant enrollments in all phases of life sciences. I thinkAt IIT will have matured to be a remarkable engine for technology commercialization.IIT will be stronger than it is today. Facilities will be better. I expect that we will have a larger student body and a stronger financial platform. We've made a lot of progress, but we still need to strengthen it.Just as anybody who hasn't visited the campus in 10 years returns to find changes, hopefully the campus will look better than it does now. It looks great, but we need to continue to enhance it. Overall, I think that 10 years from now this will be an even more exciting place to teach and learn."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/transmission-vision", "content": "It's the morning following President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech. Amid the clatter of coffee cups and flatware at a Chicago-area eatery, a voice percolates above the noontime crowd at the Moondance Caf\u00e9.\"There's alternative energy and then\u2014as the president said last night\u2014there's clean energy,\" says Paul McCoy (EE '72), a key figure in the planned Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC) wind farm project. \"In my view as a practitioner in this area for decades, he correctly stated that we need it all\u2014wind, solar, nuclear, and clean fossil fuels.\"A former ComEd senior executive and president of Trans-Elect Development Company, LLC, McCoy is widely regarded as an electrical-transmission systems expert and thought-leader on regulatory matters that have created new opportunities and directions in the energy industry. President Obama's challenge to the country to produce 80 percent of its electricity from a mix of clean energy sources by 2035 underscores the role of the massive AWC project, slated to break ground in 2013.\"This project is transformative in that it would be the first U.S. effort to construct a transmission system in the ocean to integrate individual offshore wind farms and bring the energy to shore,\" McCoy explains.AWC investors are Good Energies, a leading global investor in renewable energy and energy-efficiency industries; Google, Inc.; and the Marubeni Corporation, a Tokyo-based publicly listed trading house.In his 27 years with ComEd, McCoy became a recognized industry leader and regulatory specialist, assuming responsibility for all aspects of the company's transmission and power systems, including governance and policy issues. He initiated and developed ComEd's Wholesale Energy Marketing Group and was instrumental in the formation of the Chicago Board of Trade's electricity futures contract.During his tenure, the nation's power market was undergoing dramatic change, and in 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered utilities to open up their transmission lines to competitors. McCoy expanded his leadership role beyond ComEd while exploring opportunities created by deregulation. He led the formation of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. and is a board member and immediate past-president of WIRES, a national nonprofit group that promotes and advocates for the economic expansion of a strong electric power infrastructure.In 1999, McCoy co-founded the startup Trans-Elect. The first independent transmission company in the United States, Trans-Elect buys, builds, owns, and/or operates electric transmission systems to improve reliability in areas served by aging or overloaded regional power grids. This includes application of advanced technologies\u2014such as discrete transmission, which foregoes traditional aerial lines\u2014to increase efficiency of an existing grid and even facilitate smart grid integration. The company also serves as a transmission \"common carrier\" between electric generation and electric distribution companies.From its inception, Trans-Elect has been involved in historic electric transmission transactions. It was the first non-utility owner of a transmission system in the nation, and was the first independent transmission company\u2014now known as AltaLink\u2014in Canada. Trans-Elect also developed California's Path 15 transmission line, in a project to help solve the transmission shortcomings that contributed to the state's rolling blackouts in 2000 and 2001.\"What will phase out in the coming decade or two will be legacy coal\u2014coal developments that are from 20\u201350 years old. Some plants will be retrofitted with control technology to mitigate pollution issues; the oldest ones will quietly be retired,\" says McCoy.Energy efficiency and reliability remain a central focus of Trans-Elect, and the thrust behind the company's Primary Power Transmission System, which it is building in partnership with Tangible, LLC, an engineering and professional-services firm. Primary Power, a discrete grid system, has been designed to attach to the existing Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland Power Pool Interconnection (PJM) regional grid to help relieve congestion and increase stability within the PJM Interconnection, which currently serves 54 million people.In April 2010, Primary Power received a landmark ruling that could change the path of transmission development across the nation when the FERC decided that the project could recover its costs through regulated rates like any other existing transmission utility within PJM. The decision opened the door for independent transmission facilities, such as the Primary Power project, to be treated on equal footing with incumbent transmission owners in proposing new transmission projects. In addition to being the technical lead for Trans-Elect, McCoy directed the company's law firm as the client architect of the filing and provided testimony during the case.\"Paul is a bold and visionary engineer who has big ambitions when undertaking projects. He puts his heart and soul into his work,\" says Bodine Chair Professor Mohammad Shahidehpour, director of the Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at IIT.\"I have always viewed the provision of electric service as critical to society's safety, health, and welfare,\" says McCoy. \"Continuity of electric supply is increasingly important, whether from the common-carrier utility system or from cutting-edge projects like the IIT microgrid. Today's electric system, especially the transmission portion where I spend most of my professional time, has become more efficient and reliable over the past several decades. I take a great deal of pride in having been a small part of that.\"A telescopic view atop a wind farm turbine rising 200 feet above the Atlantic Ocean and 20 miles from shore would reveal a region in transition. Stretching across New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia is a new wind industry supporting manufacturers of turbine blades, rotors, hubs, and bearings; tool and die shops producing molds and precision-cut parts; and heavy haulers for transporting turbine towers, which can weigh as much as 80 metric tons, to the coast.Long-distance cables snake beneath the seabed, transmitting wind energy from offshore electrical converter platforms to land-based ones that deliver the power to the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland Power Pool) Interconnection regional grid. The turbine is one of a series that form a 350-mile scalable transmission backbone capable of providing 6,000 megawatts of electricity\u2014the average yearly output of six coal-powered plants\u2014to approximately 1.9 million households.Atlantic Wind Connection:DOE Wind and Water Power Program:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/slideshow-iit-main-campus-bloom", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2006/bringing-it-home", "content": "The outsourcing of millions of manufacturing jobs across borders and overseas is a largely American recipe. A look at the causes, effects, and how IIT is helping to counter this trend.America is a land of things. Multiplying by the hour, a blizzard of manufactured goods has become an inescapable component of modernity, making us forget that everything from the vitamin we swallow to the commuter jet we travel in is the result of a complex and labor-intensive process of creation. Yet if widespread reports on the state of manufacturing in the United States are credible, fewer and fewer of the goods we enjoy are being made on our shores, and a decline in America's manufacturing base may be approaching a day of reckoning.As once-vital manufacturing communities succumb to plant closings and layoffs, many experts in political, business, economic, and even national security circles fear an eventual systemic calamity. In just the past five years, America has lost roughly 3 million manufacturing jobs representing 17 percent of the manufacturing workforce. The Progressive Policy Institute places productivity's role in job loss at 40 percent. Nearly every domestic manufacturing industry, from shipbuilding to textiles to aerospace, has suffered a dispiriting reversal of fortune, at least in terms of employment.\"The wipeout is across the board. Not a single manufacturing payroll classification created a single new job,\" insists former Assistant Treasury Secretary Paul Craig Roberts, in a commentary for the Baltimore Chronicle & Sentinel about America's performance from January 2001-January 2006. Roberts ticks off some alarming figures: \"Communications equipment lost 43 percent of its workforce. Semiconductors and electronic components lost 37 percent of its workforce.... Apparel manufacturers lost almost half of the work force. Employment in textile mills declined 43 percent....\"And the list goes on.The tectonic shifts underway in manufacturing have provoked a fierce debate among economists, politicians, social scientists, industry leaders, and public policy gurus. For some, the changes at hand amount to inevitable reshufflings, growing pains along a course to greater prosperity, facilitated by a wired world of instant communication. For critics, however, the present trajectory is almost thoroughly negative, with multinational companies poised to reap spectacular rewards from emerging global markets\u2014advantages achieved, it is claimed, at the expense of workers' rights, national economies, and the environment.\"I am concerned that we do not produce enough things that other people want to buy\"\u00a0\u2014Institute of Design Director Patrick WhitneyThe polarization of opinion regarding manufacturing's current state and future prospects, however, hinges not only on analyses of winners and losers in the great economic game. The debate is also informed by differing views as to what is meant by manufacturing, for this, too, is in flux.The reasons for America's steady leakage of manufacturing jobs are not difficult to come by. Primarily, they center on two economic watchwords of the new millennium: technology and globalization. Advanced technology, though associated with increased manufacturing productivity, often displaces human workers. Computers and industrial robots slice through sheet metal, oversee factory efficiency, and perform an endless variety of assembly tasks tirelessly and with superhuman precision, allowing for a reduced workforce. Globalization allows manufacturers to draw their labor pool from across the planet, relying on an inexhaustible supply of cheap workers to manufacture goods at a fraction of the cost of domestic production.While technology and globalization have contributed to the decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S., their relative importance in manufacturing's woes remains a matter of controversy. Within industry, many insist that job losses are an inevitable price for competitiveness in the global marketplace. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) praises strides in domestic productivity, claiming such advances \"enable Americans to do more with less, increase our ability to compete, and facilitate higher wages for all employees.\" While mourning job flight, NAM has generally been a strong proponent of free trade and the unimpeded flow of capital. Love or lament it, they say, America's manufacturing paradigm has shifted, forcing businesses to adapt or succumb in a transformed marketplace.Patrick Whitney, director of IIT's Institute of Design and an authority on design innovation across cultures, reframes the problem of manufacturing's decline. Rather than decreased productivity or an offshoring mania generating a flood of cheap imports, America's limitations as an exporter and deficiencies as a domestic innovator need to be addressed. \"I am concerned that we do not produce enough things that other people want to buy,\" he says.\"Manufacturing is not dead and is not dying, but it will never again return to the 'good old days'\"\u00a0\u2014Professor Keith McKeeA study by economists Martin Baily of McKinsey & Company and Robert Lawrence of Harvard University seems to bear out Whitney's conclusions: \"Increased domestic demand is the solution to continued job weakness,\" they report, concluding that 90 percent of job losses in 2000-03 were due to domestic forces rather than trade. Productivity gains were a factor, but more important was a low demand for U.S. goods, coupled with an export weakness (exacerbated by Chinese economic policies that keep the dollar overvalued by 20 percent).One effect of manufacturing loss on the overall health of the American economy is undeniable: it has been the largest single contributor to a staggering trade deficit, currently inching toward the trillion-dollar mark. (In 2005, it reached more than $800 billion, with an accumulated value since 1990 of $4.5 trillion.) America's reliance on goods manufactured outside its borders presently amounts to twice its dependence on foreign oil. In the past, America primarily imported items that were manufactured abroad with unskilled labor, but the trend has undergone a sea change, with some of our most sophisticated high-tech consumer goods now being manufactured and, in some cases, designed outside the United States.Indeed, Advanced Technology Products (ATPs) seem to be fleeing our borders as quickly as steel production and clothing manufacture had earlier migrated to greener pastures. Two-thirds of the 650 distinct ATPs identified by the Department of Commerce are now entering the United States as imports from China. The Chinese trade surplus with the U.S. is the largest in the world, and, ironically, more than half this surplus is due to offshore production by U.S. firms for U.S. markets, a policy that critics such as Roberts consider wildly self-destructive.As noted business strategist and author Peter Fingar points out in his new book Extreme Competition: \"Original-design manufacturers, such as Quanta in Taiwan and Flextronics in Singapore, design and assemble products for international clients, supplying some 20-70 percent of the world's PCs, cell phones, PDAs, MP3 players, and digital cameras.\" Such \"ghost manufacturers\" from abroad are the authors behind many brand-name items. Meanwhile, China's recent R&D spending has increased 500 percent as the country looks to capture America's historical strong suit: talent for innovation and fresh, unprecedented design.Whitney calls for an aggressively creative and culture-specific approach to innovation, insisting, \"Design that focuses on making incremental changes to existing products will, in general, be able to be outsourced. Design that is creating newer, more innovative changes needs to be close to the people who will be using the design. If the users are in the U.S., it is likely the design will have to be done here. If the users are in China, it is likely the design will be done there.\"In addition to teaching innovative design, IIT has been involved in wide-ranging efforts to address this country's manufacturing issues. Keith McKee, director of IIT's Industrial Technology and Management Programs, believes that America must accept that manufacturing has changed. U.S. manufacturing output is increasing, he says, having gone up 5 percent last year. Such increases have been achieved by greater productivity, leading to inevitable declines in manufacturing employment. \"It is really pointless to hope that in some way, manufacturing will become less efficient so that manufacturing employment will increase. Manufacturing is doing well and is not dying, but it will never again return to the \"good old days\" where it will provide employment for unskilled workers. The manufacturing workforce for the future requires more education and a greater set of skills.\"Part of IIT's efforts, according to McKee, who is also director of IIT's Manufacturing Productivity Center, involve expanding the definition of manufacturing to include the full range of industrial operations\u2014all those activities that provide \"stuff\" to companies, the government, and the population. Industry considered in this way includes manufacturing, but it also includes building and maintaining equipment and facilities, as well as all of the activities related to moving, storing, and distributing the \"stuff.\" \"Based on this worldview, industry, representing about 30 percent of GDP and employment, is the foundation upon which the entire economy exists,\" McKee points out.\"IIT started to focus our educational programs on industry several years ago with specialization available in Manufacturing Technology, Industrial Facilities, and Industrial Logistics,\" he says. IIT's Industrial Technology and Management Programs offer a Bachelor of Industrial Technology and Management, as well as a Master of Industrial Technology and Operations.Under the leadership of the Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering, IIT has also partnered with eight other universities to take part in the National Coalition for Manufacturing Innovation (NCMI). Through research and teaching, NCMI aims to assist U.S. manufacturers to lead the world, capturing the manufacturing market and generating jobs, to distribute scientific and manufacturing news to companies, and to promote entrepreneurship.The challenge of empowering a new workforce is a daunting one. Only 6 percent of students in America pursue engineering degrees, compared with 12 percent in Europe and 40 percent in China. While the anticipation of poor job prospects may discourage some students from pursuing careers in manufacturing, others find that good schools are increasingly priced beyond their means. Additionally, more than half of U.S. engineering Ph.D.s and 34 percent of all U.S. doctoral degrees in the natural sciences are earned by foreign-born students who often return to their home nations after their visas expire.The borderless terrain of globalism provides an environment in which companies are currently competing with countries in indirect conflict, as Whitney observes: \"Companies are adapting quite readily; look at IBM's announcement about growing its workforce in India. Countries have a much more difficult problem because they are defined by a fixed geography and society. The main way for countries and their citizens to survive is through high-level education.\"Spelling out the mixed blessing of profit and loss posed by borderless trade, the Report to Congress of the U.S\u2013China Economic and Security Review Commission notes, \"Increasingly, U.S. multinationals are using China as an export platform in order to compete more aggressively in the global economy.\" The study gives an example: Wal-Mart, whose imports of Chinese goods reached $18 billion in 2004, is today the largest importer of Chinese-made products in the world.Meanwhile, if U.S. companies hope to stay competitive without outsourcing, manufacturing payroll clearly cannot be the sole or even chief defining factor, as labor costs in places like China amount to singledigit percentages of U.S. labor costs, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Instead, a focus on diversification and indispensable customer service will be required. Manutec, a metals and machining manufacturer in Milwaukee, faced steep competition from parts made in China and Mexico, reporting to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel of its 20 percent drop in sales figures in 2003. Diversifying its business plan to include highway and power plant construction and scaling back activities identified as non-productive helped Manutec regain its equilibrium.Other manufacturers benefit from geographic proximity to their domestic supplier and customer base, making outsourcing a less appealing strategy. Nevertheless, for a vast and growing manufacturing sector, the enticements of labor and design outsourcing may be too tempting to resist. Fingar speaks of the extreme competition faced by U.S. businesses in the transfigured landscape brought about by globalization: \"We are in the midst of one of the greatest economic shifts of all time. In round one of twenty-first-century globalization, the capitalists have labor on the ropes.\"For American consumers, globalization has spurred a shopping bonanza in low-priced goods, though many experts warn that without adjustments in our thinking, a steep decline in America's standard of living may be inevitable. Due primarily to the budget deficit, 2005 was the first year in U.S. history in which total spending exceeded income, yielding an unprecedented sub-zero savings rate. \"Once the pain level becomes acute,\" says Fingar, \"the DNA of our forefathers will awaken 'homo consumptus' and transform him into 'homo sapiens' once again. When that happens, watch out, world. Hopefully, that won't take an economic 9/11, though it very likely could.\"In the case of America's more immediate future, an allied effort by government, industry, and higher education is required to bolster research and development leading to new industries, and to prepare and inspire a new generation of students with the necessary skills to compete. While some companies and manufacturers will not survive aggressive competition from abroad, some will grow stronger through these economic upheavals. As Patrick Whitney notes, \"Companies learning how to design and produce things for emerging markets learn how to be more innovative and efficient. This knowledge is directly applicable to helping them compete in their more developed domestic markets.\" As for the staggering potential of emerging markets, one only need consider China's 1.3 billion citizens embedded in an economy that is growing by 10 percent per year.In light of the challenges faced, the imperative for radical, risk-taking creativity in both the design and manufacture of goods has never been more critical. Educational efforts such as those underway at IIT are helping to prepare the next generation for the full range of opportunities and challenges inherent in industry, of which manufacturing is but a part.Since 1976, IIT's Manufacturing Productivity Center (MPC) has led efforts to improve manufacturing innovation in the United States. Assisting companies both large and small, MPC boasts a client list ranging from Kraft Foods to Elkay Manufacturing to the United States Department of Defense.

'69, Ph.D. '72) did not know that he was looking at the man who would become a towering influence in his career. Nor did the Cairo native know that he had entered the university where he would spend the next 40 years.But Nagib did know that he was unsure if Chicago was a city where he wanted to stay.\"I remember looking out the window and saying, 'Is this really a place where I want to live?'\" recalls Nagib,Distinguished Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.Urged repeatedly by Fejer to remain on campus, despite the infamous Chicago winters, Nagib has done just that\u2014and IIT has reaped tremendous benefits from his decision. In addition to earning all of his degrees here, Nagib has had an extraordinarily productive career as a researcher, teacher, administrator, and facilities builder, and has made a substantial local and international impact.\"He has great passion for his work and sets exceptionally high standards for all of us in the university community,\" says. A key factor in Nagib's decision to stay on for graduate studies at IIT was the freewheeling intellectual environment\u2014cultivated by professors like Fejer and turbulence expert Mark V. Morkovin\u2014where Nagib was allowed to pursue his own research and to play a significant role in building several of the university's wind tunnels and the first world-class wind tunnel, the(FDRC).In addition to his work on the NDF, Nagib's early work centered on hydrodynamic stability. But it is in the area of flow quality of wind tunnels that he has made his largest professional mark. Nagib explains that turbulence can be either a positive or a negative force, depending on the context, and he has focused on reducing areas of resistance.The financial stakes are enormous.For example, a 7 percent reduction in resistance on the body of an airplane would equal the fuel savings that would occur if all automobiles increased their gas mileage from five miles per gallon to 60 miles per gallon.An important element in obtaining meaningful results is having a testing site with a sufficiently large Reynolds number. Named for Osborne Reynolds, the number is the ratio of intertial forces to viscous forces. Small Reynolds numbers indicate that a fluid's viscosity is dominant. Large Reynolds numbers, however, mean that viscosity is minimal and intertial effects are ascendant.During the 1980s, Nagib oversaw the construction of the larger NDF that would be an effective testing ground to make some of those advances. The tunnel contains several revolutionary design features, including the installation of a cooling system that did not add any new parts to the tunnel. The facility has become an intermediate testing ground that is larger than those in many universities, but smaller and less expensive to operate than tunnels at companies such as,, or.Completed in 1992, the tunnel was funded primarily through a government grant of about $2 million. Now valued at close to $10 million, the facility has yielded multiple benefits for IIT. In addition to drawing scholars and graduate students from across the country, it has helped to boost undergraduate student recruitment. \"They see the opportunity [and ask], 'You mean, one day I could work here?'\" Nagib says.Nagib's work also has resulted in academic programming that benefits students and distinguishes the university\u2014namely, the(IPRO) Program, a signature component of the undergraduate experience. \"He's the guy that drove the creation of IPRO, and did it with great passion, energy, and vigor,\" Collens says.A former dean and department chair, Nagib has taken pride simultaneously in helping to improve the caliber of students at IIT, serving as academic vice president (mid- to late 1990s) and becoming the founding director of IIT's Fluid Dynamics Research Center, which the United States Department of Defense recognized in the 1980s as a Center of Excellence.Perhaps foremost as a dedicated teacher, Nagib has helped to create a supportive climate at IIT in which students are unafraid to make mistakes while receiving opportunities to advance their budding careers. Nagib says he tells students not to be defensive about errors, but rather to admit them, accept them, show that they understand the mistake, and move on to the next part of the problem.He also has tried to pass to his graduates the standard of knowledge that he received from Morkovin and Fejer. \"When you start your Ph.D. work with me, I better know more about the subject than you do,\" Nagib says. \"But when you leave, you better know more about your subject than I.\"According to Candace Wark (MAE '88), former doctoral student and a current colleague of Nagib, he allowed her a lot of independence during her doctoral work and provided travel funds that enabled her to present at scholarly conferences.The reputation and facilities of the Fluid Dynamics Research Center that Nagib directed were the reasons why Wark joined the faculty after completing her doctorate.And as a young faculty member, she continued to receive support from Nagib.\"He provided the tools and motivation for me to teach, secure funding, and publish so that I could become a successful faculty member,\" says Wark, now associate dean of Armour College of Engineering.Hassan Nagib is rapidly approaching the 40th anniversary of his first visit to IIT, but his passion for research, teaching, and tackling knotty issues remains undimmed.He continues to travel widely, visiting more than a dozen countries during a recent three-month stint, and serves as co-adviser to students in some of the very same countries where he worked and studied in his youth. Last year he was elected as a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, an honor bestowed upon the most respected individuals in the aerospace industry.Nagib also co-directs an ambitious effort to answer an unresolved question. The answer\u2014the universality of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Constant\u2014could have substantial consequences for all turbulent flows adjacent to surfaces. The constant value of the logarithmic wind profile in the surface layer, the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Constant has long been held to have a value of .40, plus or minus .01.Because Nagib is not convinced, he is heading the Center for International Cooperation in Long Pipe Experiments, or CICLoPE, project in Bologna, Italy, to crack the problem.Working with a team of scholars from Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, England, Germany, Australia, Japan, and the United States, Nagib will record detailed turbulence measurements in combination with computational efforts to provide a focus of activity for leading international researchers in the field of wall-bounded turbulent flows.Occurring in long tunnels built during the period between World War I and II, his research could have industrial applications and facilitate confirmation of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Constant's validity.The quest has scientific and personal dimensions for Nagib, who calls von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n his intellectual grandfather. One of Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's students at California Institute of Technology was the late Andrew Fejer. Fejer, in turn, mentored Nagib during his undergraduate and graduate career at IIT as well as during his years as a fledgling scholar.Unearthing and proving the answer could take five years, Nagib says, while understanding and modeling the correct information could last another decade.Nagib is confident that by that time he will have left the university. \"I'll be out of this business,\" he says, smiling. \"I'll just watch the young guys do it.\"Jeff Kelly Lowenstein"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2007/innovation-design", "content": "Around the globe, design is making a splash in the development of better business.\"Like an old Cadillac.\" That's how a member of a market-research focus group described Motorola's cell phones, circa 2001. And their competitors' phones? \"Like a BMW or an Audi.\" Ouch. This unfl attering comparison\u2014and its presumable connection to Motorola's then stagnant 14 percent worldwide market share to Nokia's then 36 percent\u2014helped prompt the company to focus more on design. It restructured its design team and moved it to a sparkling new downtown Chicago offi ce. After taking the helm in 2004, CEO Ed Zander began routinely dropping by the design department to participate in product decisions, and says he expects design to be a main driver of product development.Five years later, the downtown offi ce, dubbed \"Moto City,\" has the feeling of a corporate nerve center\u2014access to sensitive areas denied to all but a handful of employees\u2014and the company's market position has been nothing short of transformed: by mid-2006, Motorola had 22 percent of the global market and was on track to sell 200 million phones for the year, led by the iconic success of the sleek, fashionable, and nearly impossibly thin RAZR (\"razor\").Jim Wicks, head of Motorola's consumer product design group, explains the strategy behind the new phones. \"The intent was to start with the basic\u00a0silhouette, and then get deeper into the character, attributes, and lines of the device,\" says Wicks. \"[As you get closer] you see the aluminum and magnesium keypad, [and] feel the signature soft touch. Then you see the way the user interface works, how it directly connects to Yahoo! or Google, how it plays music. The result is that whether you're three meters away or it's in the palm of your hand, it stands for Motorola.\"\"Companies know how to make just about anything...but they often lack a framework for determining what should be made.\" \u2014Patrick WhitneyMotorola's recent innovations are about more than simply a coolerlooking phone; they're about designing an entire user experience of seamless connectivity. While the word \"innovation\" usually conjures up associations of R&D labs, new high-tech gadgets, and scientists with cartoon light bulbs turning on over their heads, it can also include more abstract things\u2014a new business idea, a new service or brand, or a combination of the above into a seamless new experience.The continued prominence of Harvard b-school innovation guru Clayton Christianson, author of 1997's remarkably successful The Innovator's Dilemma, and new publications like BusinessWeek's \"INside Innovation\" suggest that innovation is more than a passing corporate fad. And yet, despite its popularity, innovation continues to be an almost entirely unplanned activity. \"[Almost] all fi rms are plumb lousy at it,\" says Larry Keeley, president of innovation strategy fi rm Doblin and a part-time\u00a0instructor at IIT's Institute of Design (ID).\"Some facts can help here. The average fi rm succeeds at innovation a mere 4 percent of the time.\" This is symptomatic of an activity Keeley says has reached \"about the same state as medicine had when leeches were a primary form of treatment.\"So where do managers turn when they want their organizations to innovate reliably? Keeley, and his students and fellow faculty at IIT, offer one possible answer: the world of design.Design\u2014the creation and shaping of the products, communications, services, and environments of society\u2014has been around for a long time. Its present form can be traced back to the drafting tables of early-twentieth century manufacturers, where the designer's role was to style products, advertising, and packaging to appeal to mass markets. In the interim years, however, as the global economy has shifted from mass markets to ever-more segmented local ones, the designer's role has shifted as well. No longer content with styling existing products, a growing number of designers are applying their skills to a more fundamental problem: figuring out what to make in the first place.For Patrick Whitney, ID director and Steelcase/Robert C. Pew Professor, this \"what to make gap\" [see sidebar] is a primary raison-d'etre of the modern design profession. Whitney often treats visitors to ID to an impromptu lecture on the concept. \"Companies know how to make just about anything,\" he says, sketching the gap diagram on the nearest whiteboard, \"but they often lack a framework for determining what should be made.\" According to Whitney, this gap between what producers know how to make and what consumers actually need and like, is exactly what design can fill.The skill-set of trained designers\u2014analyzing problems from a human-centered point of view, developing solutions through successive prototypes, and conveying messages with maximum clarity and effectiveness\u2014is essentially an approach to creative problem solving. Design thinking applied to the problem of making music portable, for example, led Apple not only to a successful product\u2014the iPod\u2014but also to a piece of software, iTunes, and the fi rst viable business model for selling music legally online.This kind of strategic design is nothing new. In the 1950s and 1960s, ID, under then-director Jay Doblin, helped pioneer this application of design to business problems. And a few smart companies have used design strategically at least since Josiah Wedgwood industrialized the nineteenthcentury London pottery business, bringing mass production to what had been, literally, a cottage industry. Until recently, though, strategic design was not a common industry practice; but there are signs this is beginning to change.\"Nobody is educating prospective managers in how to thinkThat's exactly what we can do.\" \u2014Harvey Kahalas\"The emergence of China and India [as global economic powers],\" wrote a 2005 BusinessWeek editorial, \"will force every single major corporation in [the West] to choose between offering ever lower-cost, lower-value goods, or innovating to create new, higher-cost, highervalue goods.\" It went on, \"[But] how do you generate profi table innovation? [We've] been hard at work for decades churning out numbers-oriented, metricmeasuring, linear-focused executives who are much better at managing costs than managing imagination. So where should executives go to learn how to turn themselves and their companies into great innovators?\"Six months later, BusinessWeek answered its own question, coining a new term\u2014 \"d-schools\"\u2014 to describe a small group of design schools offering innovation managers a serious alternative to traditional M.B.A.s. Among them were IIT's Institute of Design and Stanford's newly formed Hasso Platner Institute of Design; several others have since joined the list. And a barrage of press coverage in BusinessWeek, Fast Company, Newsweek and elsewhere has led many managers of innovation to discover strategic design.One of those managers is Doug Look (M.D.M. '06), a product manager who got an early taste for user research while working for AutoDesk, Inc., maker of AutoCAD and other leading design automation software. \"We were out there speaking to customers, understanding their needs, helping refine\u00a0new products,\" recalls Look. But the company's methods were focused on validating existing concepts, not generating new ones. \"Then I read some articles in BusinessWeek and thought, 'Wow, that sounds a lot like what we're doing, but it's taking it another step.'\"ID's Master of Design Methods (M.D.M.) degree was created in 2003, partly as a way of teaching design thinking to the large number of innovation professionals who, like Look, aren't in traditional design roles. It's a two-semester crash course in design methods for business, and enrollment has doubled annually since it was created.In 2006, ID launched another program combining business and design: a threeyear Master of Design/M.B.A. dual degree, offered with IIT's Stuart School of Business. Harvey Kahalas, Stuart's dean, says the program addresses a growing need. \"Many recruiters have said to me, 'I know where to get traditional M.B.A.s. I know the top schools,'\" says Kahalas. \"'But those schools are educating people to practice continuous improvement in what they're already doing\u2014nobody is educating prospective managers in how to think differently.' That's exactly what we can do.\"As the traditional M.B.A. becomes a commodity degree and employers seek experts in the fuzzy practice of innovation, many young professionals are turning to design (or design- fl avored) education to advance their careers.Back at Moto City, Brad Nemer (M.Des./M.B.A. '04) swipes his corporate keycard and enters the restricted access area. Although he has a backstage pass of sorts to the top-secret design department, Nemer, despite his degree, doesn't consider himself a designer. A product portfolio manager, he works \"upstream\" from design in the product development process. Still, Nemer sees himself as a catalyst for good design at Motorola. \"I can infl uence the life or death of a product in a way I couldn't from the design department,\" he points out. \"Part of it is business thinking, like how many customers are there, how many can we reach, how much will it cost to reach them. But the other part is that what makes a great phone is 80 percent design. Design is so important [because] the user experience is so important.\"Nemer is blunt, however. Without the M.B.A., he wouldn't have the job. \"The baseline [for working here] is a business background. But it is a huge edge to be conversant in design and be sensitive to those issues.\" As global competition for the hearts and minds of consumers continues to grow, businesses are starting to recognize the value of user-centered design strategy, and the new breed of professionals who know how to practice it."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2005/search-cure", "content": "At IIT, dozens of students and faculty are pursuing cutting-edge research in cancer prevention and care. While they may be conducting their work quietly, they are being noticed. From a new $22 million grant to assess the relationship between cell phones and cancer to funding that supports innovations in x-ray imaging, IIT's cancer researchers are leading a powerful search for a cure.is standing at a table surrounded by bottles of chemicals and dozens of vials.

By producing highly detailed images of soft tissue, the method may take the guesswork out of breast cancer diagnosis, while also reducing the radiation dose to the patient. If approved by the, it will represent the first fundamental change in the way medical x-ray images are made since their introduction in the late nineteenth century.But there are engineering problems still to be solved.Although it might not be as well known as other on-going studies, cancer research is thriving at labs across campus. Teams from life sciences, engineering, and(IITRI) are facing the future head on, studying the drugs, treatments, and technology that may take us closer to finding a cure. And because they have no university hospital affiliation, they are conducting nearly every aspect of research directly on site.\"Cancer research at IIT is a little-known gem,\" says, dean of the. \"I don't think most people realize that we have researchers delving into a number of significant issues, from understanding what prevents cancer cells from dying off naturally, to how to kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells.\"In life sciences, understanding the former is a work in progress for Jialing Xiang, assistant professor of biology. The adult body, she explains, has roughly 10,000 billion cells, and good health depends upon maintaining the right number. \"There are two ways to do this,\" she says. \"One is to control the growth rate. The second is to control what we call a 'suicide program' or cell death program, in which the cells die by themselves.\"The cell death program is called apoptosis, which is Greek for 'falling of leaves from a tree.' As cells die by apoptosis, they literally fall off their supporting structure. The process eliminates extraneous cells, or cells that are already damaged.The concept of apoptosis is just 30 years old, and Xiang is traveling down a little-chartered path. The conventional thinking is that cancer is caused by out-of-control growth; the newer concept is that it can also be caused by a dysfunction of the cell death, or suicide, program.Xiang and her team are studying the program at the molecular level, trying to find out where and how apoptosis goes wrong. Why can't certain bodies get rid of their bad cells? Why can't they activate their suicide program? She is trying to find a clue that's applicable for a variety of cancers- breast, prostate, leukemia, andamong them.\"The goal is to discover the problem and provide the information to drug designers for cancer prevention,\" says Xiang. \"Unless they know the source of the problem, they can't find the solution.\"Joy Chong, assistant professor of chemistry, is working on precision. She is developing cancer drugs that can be employed for a new cancer therapeutic technology called(RIT). The goal is to provide a lethal dose of radiation only to tumor cells without causing radiation toxicity to healthy cells.At the end of her research which, she cautions, is many years in the future lies the exciting possibility of cancer that can no longer metastasize, or spread from one part of the body to another.\"The effectiveness of the technology is based on two factors,\" she says. One is the use of a \"smart tracing agent\" the result of an antibody binding with a toxin or antigen enzyme that is expressed on tumor cells. Using a synthetic linker, radiation is attached to the smart tracing agent, which attracts tumors. Then RIT employs tumor-targeting antibodies for highly selective delivery of the radiation, reaching the cancerous cells and minimizing the exposure of healthy, normal cells.\"This antibody-targeted radiotherapeutic approach is very promising,\" says Chong, \"in that a variety of tumor types can be selectively treated based on antigen-antibody affinity.\" In addition to being effective on several types of tumors, the RIT drug has been shown to significantly enhance the overall response rate of treatment. Still another benefit: It is better tolerated in cancer patients than chemotherapy.It is clear that the RIT technology cannot be effective without the appropriate drug. Chong is working to bring it to life and to eliminate the ability of the deadly disease to spread.At IITRI, researchers are working on preventing cancer altogether. Cancer research has been conducted at the institute since the 1960s, when IITRI was awarded a series of programs from the(NCI) to evaluate the activity of novel cancer drugs in experimental model systems. Within the following 30 years, IITRI researchers tested thousands of new drugs and natural product extracts, a number of which are now in common use in clinical oncology.In the 1970s a separate initiative brought an NCI grant for researchers to study chemopreventive agents. \"At the time chemoprevention was controversial; lots of people thought it couldn't work,\" says, professor of Biology and senior vice-president and director of IITRI. \"But we demonstrated very clearly in experimental model systems that it did work. IITRI was one of the first labs to generate significant data to show this was a viable approach for cancer control.\"Today, one chemoprevention researcher is, professor of Biology, assistant vice president of IITRI, and head of IITRI's carcinogenesis and chemopreventive division. His goal is to find a nontoxic chemopreventive agent that may also work on already-established tumors.The method might be through dietary alterations. Or it might be accomplished by identifying a compound in what is known as a 'functional food' or a natural or synthetic substance, and providing that to high-risk groups.Mehta is particularly interested in gauging the impact on breast cancer of a vitamin D analog, which may help patients who develop resistance to standard anti-estrogen treatment. He also is studying the impact of resveratrol, a substance found in grapes and red wine, on the prevention of lung cancer.And he is working on formulating the chemopreventive agent not as a procedure, but as a pill, taken once a day.Mehta's project is one of approximately 20 active cancer research programs at IITRI. Last year the institute was awarded $28 million from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for three five-year programs. The first is a $17.3 million program to study the toxicology of new drugs developed for cancer therapy. The other two programs total $10.8 million and support studies to identify new agents for cancer prevention and to study the toxicology and pharmacology of cancer preventive agents prior to their entry into clinical trials.One of the studies concerns changes in gene expression in tumors in comparison to normal tissues. Over expression, McCormick explains, is \"if a gene normally produces 50 of something, and this gene produces 100 or 200 or 500.\" He continues, \"If we can identify a gene that is over expressed in a particular type of tumor, it might be a good target for a cancer preventive drug. The argument goes that if we can prevent the over expression, we may be able to prevent the cancer.\"Two active programs are focused on identifying changes in gene expression that occur as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke and the influence of chemopreventive agents on those changes. IITRI molecular biologists are also collaborating with IITRI toxicologists to study the effects of chemopreventive agents on gene expression in normal tissues, with the goal of identifying early markers of toxicity.\"IITRI chemoprevention programs include efforts to prevent cancer in a number of organ systems, with emphasis on the breast, prostate, lung, and colon,\" says McCormick. These studies are designed both to evaluate the efficacy of new agents in experimental models for these cancers, and to support the development of the most active agents prior to their entry into clinical trials. Programs in cancer therapy involve studies of new vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, new drugs that are designed to target specific biochemical or molecular pathways essential for tumor growth, and traditional cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.Still other studies include looking at pharmacokinetics, the study of patterns of drug absorption and clearance by the body. When the studies are completed, we may know how long drugs stay in the bloodstream, how they're metabolized, and where they go after being administered.On the environmental side, IITRI recently received a $22 million grant from the() to participate in an international program studying the potential link between cell phones and cancer. The program will extend into 2011 and require the construction of a specialized laboratory facility. A group of scientists in Switzerland will build the facility and install it in IITRI's labs, and a group of pathologists will be involved in an evaluation of the studies.This is not the first time IITRI has been involved in such a project. A decade ago the institute participated in a study to see if 60 Hz magnetic fields, the type of fields generated by appliances and overhead power lines, were linked to cancer. The cell phone study will have broader participation and more money, and will generate the most detailed and thorough evaluation of cell phone frequencies that have yet been performed.Last year at the, IIT researchers established the(MIRC), a group of faculty, staff, and students who are working in a collaborative environment to drive medical imaging as we know it into the next generation.Many of MIRC's research projects are targeted at the development of advanced techniques for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. For example, Miles Wernick, associate professor ofand, along with his colleaguesand Yongyi Yang, are continuing IIT's tradition as a leader in the development of advanced x-ray imaging technologies.\"In standard x-ray imaging, the pictures aren't very good,\" says Wernick, who is also director of MIRC. \"They do a particularly bad job of showing soft tissue. But conventional x-ray imaging is fast and inexpensive, so it is still widely used, especially in mammography.\"Whereas standard x-ray imaging measures only absorption of x-rays by the body, the new technology multiple- image radiography or MIR, can also measure two kinds of refraction effects, which are microscopic deflections of the x-rays as they pass through the body. This presents a much more detailed image than conventional x-rays.\"We have a $1.7 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the feasibility of using the MIR technique in hospitals for breast cancer imaging as a replacement for standard mammography,\" says Wernick. And his team also shares a $3.5 million NIH grant withto study the use of MIR imaging to assess cartilage degeneration in patients with. If approved and adopted by the medical profession (\"Getting people to change their habits can be difficult,\" he says), this technology will represent the first fundamental change in how medical x-ray images are made since the discovery of x-rays in the 1890s.In addition to developing new imaging techniques, MIRC researchers are creating new tools to help radiologists make the best use of the images they have now. Yang, associate professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is taking the lead on a project to create a search engine that can access a large database of mammograms and recall those that are most similar to a given patient's images. Since these historical images have known outcomes, they can be used as a frame of reference for diagnosing the patient's condition.One of the major elements of this and other computer-aided diagnosis techniques is a collection of algorithms that are used for automatically detecting and analyzing abnormalities in breast images. Yang and Wernick, working with Ana Lukic, a research associate in Biomedical Engineering, have developed advanced mathematical algorithms that find abnormalities in mammograms with much greater accuracy than existing techniques.In other research sponsored by NCI, MIRC's Mark Anastasio, assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering, is developing new imaging methods that will help physicians provide better radiation therapy to their cancer patients, while decreasing their radiation exposure. And, assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering, also of MIRC, is developing new MRI imaging methods that will help surgeons to avoid damaging vital nerves when removing brain tumors. \"This is why the MIRC was created- to move medical imaging into important new directions,\" says Wernick. \"The work going on today in the MIRC won't be in the clinic tomorrow, but several of our current projects could ultimately have a major impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment.\"Although the outcomes of IIT and IITRI's studies are as yet unknown, one thing is not: As these cancer studies move forward, other projects are gearing up. For example, IIT researchers will begin to look at the relationship between cancer and connexins. Connexins are components of 'gap junctions,' cell-to-cell channels that permit ions and small molecules to move between adjacent cells. They differ from tissue to tissue, and connexin mutations have been responsible for a number of different diseases, including deafness and peripheral neuropathy.\"In science, as one study is completed, another is underway. It's a never-ending continuum,\" says Dean McMorris. \"When you solve one question, it raises questions about something else.\"And as Xiang says about whether cancer will be cured in our lifetime, \"I hope so. It depends on how much we can dig out from this deadly disease.\"External Links:Scientists are hopeful that chemoprevention, the use of natural or synthetic substances to prevent cancer before it develops, can reduce the chances of cancer in both high-risk individuals and in the general population. An effective chemopreventive agent may also reduce the incidence of second primary cancers in patients who have had their first cancer cured.Although a new theory seems to surface every day in the popular press, a non-toxic chemopreventive agent that is 100 percent effective has yet to be developed. In an effort to achieve that goal, the National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a number of programs to identify and develop new chemopreventive agents. Cancer chemoprevention programs in progress at IITRI involve studies of a broad range of drugs and natural products, including"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2007/yesterday-today-and-tomorrow", "content": "In 1944, a fresh-faced 18 year old namedenrolled at IIT for what he thought would be a semester or two break from California Institute of Technology. He's been here ever since.Pritzker has done just about every job possible at IIT during the past 62 years, earning a degree, returning to teach night classes to undergraduates, joining the Board of Trustees in 1962, and heading the board since 1990. That is to say nothing about the $60 million he and Robert Galvin each gave to the university in 1996\u2014at the time, the largest charitable pledge ever made to a single institution in the Chicago metropolitan area.Incoming Board Chair andCorporation Chief Executive Officer John W. Rowe invokes a lofty comparison when asked to evaluate Pritzker's contributions to IIT.\"That's like asking, 'How do you assess George Washington?'\" says Rowe, citing Pritzker's years of service and judicious actions in stabilizing the university.The foundation of Pritzker's passion for the university was laid during his undergraduate career.One of his highlights during that time was studying under, a 1978 Nobel Prize winner in economics. Pritzker always arrived early for classes with Simon, and often would be the last student to leave the classroom. \"He got a kick out of me,\" the soft-spoken Pritzker says, chuckling at the memory of his former professor.More generally, Pritzker found that IIT was an excellent match for his ambition of going into manufacturing. \"If you wanted to run a factory, you got a good education,\" says Pritzker, who still works full time as chief executive officer of., a company that manages an international group of manufacturing and service companies. He has served as president of Colson since 1954.After graduating from IIT in 1946, Pritzker taught evening courses for a few years in such subjects as statistical quality control. After being affiliated with other universities, he joined IIT's Board of Trustees in early 1962.Pritzker points with pride to the increased safety, the revamped and more attractive exterior of buildings, and the higher quality of students attending IIT during his tenure on the board. Despite taking pleasure in the gains the university has made, Pritzker feels strongly that more work remains to be done. He cites the need to upgrade the facilities inside the buildings, to recruit more star faculty members, and to boost IIT's endowment.Speaking at a tribute dinner in September, President Lew Collens said that Pritzker and Galvin's challenge gift has had multiple positive consequences for IIT, including the establishment of the Camras Scholars program and several faculty chair programs, and the forging of a partnership with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley to invest in the neighborhood.Collens also praised Pritzker's \"fierce commitment\" to IIT, which was never more on display than in May 1995, when Pritzker taught a class at, flew back to Chicago for a vital board meeting, and then immediately returned to Oxford in time for his next class.Although relieved not to be spending quite as many evenings at IIT as he had during the past four decades, Pritzker says that he will miss the pleasure of interacting with professors and working with Collens. And, while he is glad to be passing the board chairmanship on to a man he sees as a worthy successor, Pritzker also made it clear that his commitment to his alma mater will not end anytime soon.\"I'm on the search committee for the new president, so they've already fixed that up,\" he says, a broad smile creasing his face. \"I had a meeting yesterday for about three hours, and I've got one next week, and there will be a dinner tomorrow.\"\"So far, it hasn't been a problem,\" says Pritzker.Incoming Board Chairsees himself as a catalyst to help IIT move to its next stage of development.\"IIT is an institution with a stable educational core thanks to the leadership of Lew Collens,\" says Rowe, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Exelon Corporation, one of the nation's largest utility companies. \"This school is at a point where it needs some fresh vision from a leader who can start with the base that Lew built rather than the crisis Lew inherited.\"\"Getting a higher sense of activity, participation, and meaning is one of the things that a board chair can do\u2014I have lots of conversations,\" Rowe says.But Rowe does a lot more than talk.One of Chicago's most successful businessmen and renowned for his philanthropy, the 61 year old brings extensive professional and civic qualification to his new post.Rowe's leadership at Exelon has been widely recognized. In 2004, the company was named the top utility inlist of \"The World's 2,000 Leading Companies,\" and in 2005 the magazine gave Exelon the same rank on its list of best-managed companies.\"Getting a higher sense of activity, participation, and meaning is one of the things that a board chair can do...I have lots of conversations.\"\u2212\u00a0John W. RoweIn addition to running the utility giant, Rowe has served on the board of trustees of more than a dozen prominent institutions, ranging fromto theto the. He currently serves as chair of the.Rowe also has a history of involvement with IIT.Although he is not an IIT alumnus, Rowe worked with former Governor James R. Thompson as the vice chairman of the Mies van der Rohe Society, and then chaired the same group before joining the Board of Trustees.Rowe's blend of experiences attracted the attention of Collens and Pritzker, who asked Rowe to serve on IIT's board more than two years ago, with an eye toward eventually asking him to assume the role of chair.\"He is somebody who has very broad intellectual interests\u2014a very accomplished corporate leader who is extraordinarily well regarded in the Chicago community,\" Collens says. \"City leaders and philanthropists will all tell you that he is somebody very special.\"Rowe points out that he likes what he sees at IIT. \"The College of Architecture is a great school, and Chicago-Kent College of Law has carved out a very productive niche for itself,\" he says.He adds that engineering and fields like physics and chemistry at IIT do not have a clear understanding of where they fit in the national research landscape: \"Engineering and hard sciences are looking to say, 'How do we compare to famous universities like MIT or Caltech? What is the IIT niche compared to, say, the University of Illinois?'\"\"I think one of my tasks is to help IIT define the niche for its hard technology core,\" Rowe says. This clarification process will not be conducted in isolation, he explains. Rather, it will happen through conversations with faculty, other board members, and Collens' successor, whom Rowe will play a large role in helping to select\u2014a task he says will be his \"biggest contribution\" to the university.\"The role of the chair is to help make certain we get a successor with vision,\" says Rowe, who expects a replacement to be in place by the end of the academic year. \"It's the president who sets the vision. [I can] help to make [sure] that the executive committee and other board members can contribute to that vision.\"Rowe has the confidence of his predecessor as he begins an undertaking that will impact IIT for decades to come.\"To say that he's very intelligent would be kind of obvious, but I believe he thinks deeply about things,\" says Pritzker. \"He's an outstanding leader\u2014very forceful, and correctly so.\"\"I think we really lucked out on this one,\" says Pritzker."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2007/series-miracles", "content": "In the days leading up to August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina began to unwind like a watch spring, swelling to fill the Gulf of Mexico as it cycled landward.In the Big Easy, mounting unease seized the public, as meteorological predictions began pointing the storm's destination at the heart of New Orleans. Closer to the moment of landfall, however, a slight perturbation readjusted Katrina's probable path east, to the Mississippi/Louisiana border. By the time it had left, 98,000 square miles of terrain had been affected, with some of the hardest hit areas along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. In his synopsis of Katrina, The Great Deluge, Douglas Brinkley likened the horror to the Civil War landscape of the South after William Tecumseh Sherman's apocalyptic destruction. \"Not since Atlanta had been burned to the ground had a swath of Dixie looked so wretchedly barren,\" he wrote.In the city of Gulfport, Miss., Katrina unleashed unprecedented devastation. Officials reported that buildings downtown \"imploded\" during the morning hours under the combined impact of raging wind and catastrophic flooding.Shortly after the storm's passing and some 880 miles to the northwest of Gulfport, IIT Professor of Architecturefollowed the stories of destruction with the rest of the nation. The news hit Flury hard, especially the devastation along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, where he'd spent many good times and had developed a deep affection for the people and unique Southern culture there.\"It is powerful for a student to gain a sensual understanding of building by cutting and crafting a piece of wood or feeling the heat, weight, and odor involved in welding steel, and the astonishment of opening concrete formwork.\"\u00a0\u2014Frank FluryFlury hoped to take a more personal approach to the recovery effort, and he planned to include IIT\u2014in particular, his architecture students\u2014in his ambitious vision. The idea was simple: use his talents and resources to rebuild just one structure Hurricane Katrina had pitilessly demolished.The first person Flury enlisted in the undertaking was, who pledged her fundraising, public relations, and institutional support. The path to rebuilding was now paved, though the project's challenges had just begun.Despite urgent need across the broad stretch of the storm's path, finding a client for a rebuilding effort was not as easy as one might expect. As Flury, a native of Germany, recalls: \"Well, we couldn't just have this strange guy with a German accent call and say, 'I want to send you a building!'\" After researching the devastation, Flury was put in contact with the, a unique facility whose award-winning interactive children's museum opened in 1998. With Katrina, the school and exhibition space had fallen drearily silent. The Artist Studio and office were reduced to rubble and the grounds littered with the mangled remnants of homes, cars, trees, and power lines.Lynn Meadows Executive Director Betsy Grant recalls a serendipitous meeting with the Gulfport superintendent of schools: \"He told me some guy from Chicago wants to come and make a building in Gulfport, asking if I wanted to meet him. 'A building?' I asked. You better believe it!\"Thus, a perfect architect-client relationship was born.Flury's plan was to design a new multi-purpose community center remotely with his IIT students, fabricate the sections, ship the entire structure to the site in Mississippi, and build it.Flury has long been dedicated to the design/build ethos, which stresses both sides of the architecture experience: \"It is powerful for a student to gain a sensual understanding of building by cutting and crafting a piece of wood or feeling the heat, weight, and odor involved in welding steel, and the astonishment of opening concrete formwork,\" he explained in a Chicago symposium devoted to design/build theory.Following Katrina, Flury established three separate teams devoted to design, construction, and fund-raising efforts. That each of the students involved participated without college credit\u2014contributing to a worthy cause and gaining valuable experience\u2014is testament to their dedication.Obtaining necessary funding for the complicated undertaking was a challenge. As, IIT vice president for External Affairs, who coordinated the fundraising, explains, there was a danger of Katrina fatigue among potential donors, and local resources in the Gulfport region were already massively overextended as the struggling community attempted to cope with the storm's aftermath. Thus began a series of miracles as contributors appeared, often seemingly out of thin air, to offer money, materials, manpower, expertise, and equipment.The design phase of the project began to take shape in Chicago, with Flury and 10 students batting around possibilities before poring over architectural sketches the students had rendered of the future structure. The creative process was tempered not only by financial constraints, but also by climate considerations, client needs, and an aggressive time frame that allowed the students only 10 days in Gulfport to complete the structure.Various designs were explored, including a domed building able to withstand high winds. The final choice was for a vernacular schoolhouse of elegant, weather-resistant cedar. It would feature a large, 24x16 room suitable for a variety of activities, as well as a screened porch so that the children could enjoy learning outside, safe from the region's notorious insect life.Flury also stresses the energy-efficiency of the design: \"The building is very highly insulated, with 2x6 rather than 2x4 walls and lots of crossventilation, reducing the need for air conditioning.\"After pre-fabrication of the structure, a task involving 25 IIT students, the materials were trucked to Mississippi in a tractor-trailer donated through the Rotary Club of Darien, Ill. Meeting the truck, Flury and a nine-member construction team immediately set to work. Most of the building of the outer structure was completed in a lightning-speed two days of intense labor.After a vigorous 10 days, the structure was almost complete. It was time for the students to return home. Flury stayed on in Gulfport to see the project through to completion, a little nervous about the daunting task ahead: \"Less than 10 percent was left to do, but that's a lot. It's a little like standing next to a mountain with a shovel, and you have to move it!\" he laughs.But new miracles were afoot as the Gulfport community, inspired by the efforts of the strangers from Illinois, contributed on multiple levels to get the job done. Volunteers from bothand Hands On joined individual community members. As part of the Rotary connection, Long Beach, Miss., Rotary President Robert D. Kranz secured a free air conditioning unit, surprising Flury with it one day.sent a team of 20 to crown the finished center with the gift of a first-class roof, ideally suited to the Mississippi climate.The IIT community responded as well. Ten alumni, trustees, and friends joined three corporations in their support of the project, donating everything from financial contributions to construction and electrical supplies toward the completion of the structure.The center was completed just in time for a gala opening ceremony, which took place on July 1. Two IIT students, Kaitlin Streyle (ARCH 3rd year) and Hollister, were fortunate enough to be part of the emotional event, a time of looking back and of gratification. \"Everyone gave 100 percent to the project,\" Streyle recalls, adding, \"It was amazing to see the finished building and to see Betsy and everyone at Lynn Meadows again.\"Hollister, who had been involved with the project since its inception, stresses the cohesiveness of the effort: \"One of the most important things was the attitude of everybody down there,\" he says. Both students agreed that despite the long, hot days and sore muscles, the experience was deeply rewarding. \"It was the first time I'd been involved in construction,\" says Streyle. \"It was a great learning experience. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.\"The Lynn Meadows facility was the first rebuilding effort along this stricken area of Mississippi coast, a beacon of rejuvenation. As Director Betsy Grant notes: \"When people are living in atrailer with four kids, they really need a place to go!\"Today, innovative programs at Lynn Meadows are again inspiring children and their parents, with lively, interactive museum displays, theater workshops, dance classes, and more. The new 1,000-square-foot building donated and assembled by Flury and his students has proven remarkably versatile for the school's needs.\"All of us were hell-bent and determined. And we got it done,\" says Grant.Back at IIT, architecture students inspired by their work in Gulfport have formed a new group, Architecture That Matters, which will pursue other design/build efforts useful to the community and informed by social consciousness.Richard Harth.IIT's Frank Flury teaches design/build architecture, which encourages students to explore the synergistic relationship between the mind that conceptualizes and the hands that make things. The process itself dates from man's earliest architectural efforts, such as the dwellings of mammoth bone and animal hide found in the Central Russian Plain. Later, Renaissance architects were intimately involved with all phases of construction of their cathedrals and other structures.Specialization, however, eventually drew the fields of design and building apart, and many architects began to lose their intimate familiarity with materials and techniques of construction. A resurgence of the design/build approach took off in the late twentieth century, as new attempts were made to reintegrate conceptualization with a tactile awareness of materials and building techniques. Advantages of the design-build approach include:At IIT, a comprehensive approach\u2014one that identifies architectural design as but a first step in the process of a building's creation\u2014is encouraged and taught. Flury and students have applied this model in various environments, including a design/build island sculpture pavilion and a rural housing project for the disadvantaged in Alabama. Plans also are underway for a design/build studio and exhibition space in Pass Christian, Miss. Meanwhile, a new student organization, Architecture That Matters, seeks to explore other design/build opportunities of benefit to communities in need."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/my-interview-lew-collens", "content": "In 1990, I was chairman of the Board of Trustees and also headed the search committee to hire IIT's new president.When I interviewed Lew Collens, an internal candidate for the job, I wanted to quiz him in the same way that I would an outsider, so that there would be a level playing field.We had lunch together, and during our conversation I said, \"You're dean of Chicago-Kent College of Law. IIT is a school where engineering is very important. Do you have any interest in technical things?\"He said, \"Of course, I do.\"\"How do you get to IIT in the morning?\" I asked.He answered that he drove.\"How does an automobile work?\" I asked. I figured that someone who is really interested in science would know that kind of thing.Lew had no idea, no clue at all.We discussed this in the search committee and decided that Lew was still the best person for the job.When I presented Lew to the Executive Committee, he was obliged to give a thank you.He said, \"I'm surprised I'm here. When Bob interviewed me, he asked me if I knew how a car worked. I said, 'It's easy. You get in the car, adjust the mirror, and put the key in the ignition. A puff of smoke comes out the back, and you go.'\"Bob's response was, 'You're a typical lawyer: all smoke and mirrors!'\"That's such a good line, I wish I really had said it."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/iit-challenge-campaign", "content": "When I joined IIT in 1994, it was in the midst of a long-range planning effort, the National Commission for IIT. Led by President Lew Collens and Bob Galvin, and staffed by David Baker, the charge of the commission was to envision a future that would successfully set the university apart from its competitors.At that time, IIT and many of its fellow technological universities were suffering enrollment shortfalls, particularly at the undergraduate level. Competition for students interested in a rigorous math- and science-based education was intense. IIT was in a fundraising campaign that had stalled.: What will it take to get more highly able undergraduates to come to IIT?People had such great trust in Lew's integrity, intelligence, ability, and most importantly, his dedication to IIT, that donors felt comfortable investing in IIT.Lew, Bob Galvin, and Bob Pritzker had been working on this problem for some time. While the report of the commission had some terrific ideas, none could be realized without a very significant influx of money. That meant increased enrollments and increased gift support.Lew came up with the idea of a special scholarship program that would provide full tuition, room, and board for 30 exceptional undergraduate engineering students. The program would provide five years of support and once in place, would support up to 150 students. He proposed to \"the Bobs\" that they fund one class as a test. If IIT was able to attract the students envisioned, the program would go forward and an endowment would have to be created to support it.The program was named the Camras scholars program after the famous IIT scientist and inventor, Marvin Camras. When it became apparent that the test would be a great success\u2014the first class had hundreds more applicants than it could admit\u2014the Bobs and Lew began serious discussions about how the program would be funded.We had already closed the stalled campaign and had used the excellent work of the National Commission to support a six-month planning process for a new campaign. People understood that if any of the campaign objectives were to be met, some very serious lead gifts would have to be made.During the summer and early fall of 1996, Hassan Nagib, then vice president and provost, and I worked quietly with Lew to prepare materials for his discussions with the Bobs. They were considering funding the entire Camras endowment\u2014$120 million. As those discussions continued, they wanted more detail on how a major comprehensive campaign would be formed around a commitment of that magnitude. Finally, they concluded that rather than the two of them funding the Camras endowment and then having IIT launch a campaign to fund other critical objectives, it would be wiser to create a $120-million challenge. In this way, each and every donor's gift would be doubled, and every member of the IIT community would have an incentive to raise money.It was a clever idea, and I have to say that our faculty and donors used it to the fullest advantage. Every dean knew that the way they received money from the challenge was to earn it, and every dean went after that match aggressively. We had lots of creative ideas such as EnPROs, which are the entrepreneurship extension of the IPRO concept, and the creation of the Heald Scholars. Camras was so successful that we had young people wanting to come to IIT if we were able to give them just some aid, and we had donors who resonated to that need.As the IIT Challenge Campaign began to have an impact, IIT began to transform. Camras students brought greater intellectual and interpersonal energy. That had a halo effect on all students.The challenge gifts\u2014$60 million from both Bob Pritzker and family and Bob Galvin and family\u2014were announced in November 1996, and we were off running on a five-year, $250-million comprehensive campaign.Working with Lew during this period was great fun. He was terrific at engaging people in discussions about their interests and in finding substantive linkages between those interests and IIT priorities. He invested a tremendous amount of personal time working with staff or academic leadership to create individualized strategies to engage and invite major gift prospects to support their interests through a gift to IIT. He was\u00a0 generally pretty patient when things got bogged down or delayed\u2014notice that I said \"generally\"! People had such great trust in Lew's integrity, intelligence, ability, and most importantly, his dedication to IIT, that donors felt comfortable investing in IIT.\u00a0 It is important to note that Lew's wife, Marge, was very good to work with during the campaign. Marge is an exceptional fundraiser, and having her experience and dedication to IIT was a tremendous asset.Lew would be first to remind anyone writing about that period of time and about the campaign that the campaign was ultimately about the students. The Camras program was a tipping point, and it was focused on students. A very large percentage of the gifts given were for student aid, and when donors came to campus, it was generally students with whom they wanted to meet.We were able to reach the IIT Challenge Campaign amount in just four years. As the effect of the gifts began to have an impact, IIT began to transform. The Camras students brought greater intellectual and interpersonal energy. That had a halo effect on all students.The campus began to change with the implementation of the landscaping master plan. The design and construction of The McCormick Tribune Campus Center ignited a buildings transformation that continues today with the just-renovated S. R. Crown Hall, the new State Street Village student residence, and a new soccer field.If you go back to the National Commission and then to the idea to create the Camras program, the extraordinary commitments of two wonderful men\u2014Bob Pritzker and Bob Galvin\u2014and you look at the common denominator, the \"causal factor\" if you will, I think you would have to say it was Lew Collens."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/building-university-technology-park-iit", "content": "IIT's 1996 Main Campus Master Plan called for a \"commercial zone\" on the south end of campus. In 2000, as the City of Chicago decided to move its new police headquarters to near Main Campus and to take down public housing around IIT, President Lew Collens said, \"Let's do a tech park.\" He turned to me and asked me to figure out how to do it. Needless to say it has had a big impact on me professionally.By 2001, the key thinking behind the scenes became, \"If we are going to build a tech park, who is going to pay for it?\"To begin financing, we turned first to the State of Illinois, which in 2001 committed $12 million to pay for the Incubator, an investment that inspired many others to get involved.In 2002, after IIT sold the majority of its assets in IIT Research Institute (IITRI) to Alion Science and Technology, the south side of campus became available for the development of the park. IIT took control of two underutilized buildings and devised reinvestment strategies to renovate those buildings, which became the Incubator and Technology Business Center. None of this work required dollars from the Alion spin-off. Most important, we found a private developer-partner, Wexford Science and Technology, who bought one of the old IITRI buildings from us and agreed to develop it.There was still one big hurdle: we had to guarantee the developer that we would occupy the building. Somebody needed to lease a quarter of the building in order for the developer to proceed with the renovation financing.Fortunately, the late Life Trustee Charlie Shaw worked with Lew and me to help the Board of Trustees understand that this was an appropriate risk.One of the most distinctive aspects of the park is its integration with IIT's academic programs and vision.Another critical step in the financing was obtaining Tax Increment Financing (TIF) status from the City of Chicago. It's a funny story.We had completed and sent the city our TIF application. Someone from the Department of Planning and Development called us to meet.When we arrived, he said, \"By the way, the mayor wants you to respect the green building standards, either by having a green roof or by meeting the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards.\"I had been trying to convince the developer's lawyer to pay attention to whether we needed to meet these standards, but he told us the project was a renovation, so it did not apply.That wasn't true. The man from Planning and Development insisted, \"You've got to do this.\"Everyone from our team exchanged a look.But then our architect said, \"That's no problem. I designed the building to meet the LEED standards; we just didn't want to pay to submit the paperwork.\"We all exchanged a much happier look, got the approval, and moved forward with the project.In November 2006, we held the grand opening of University Technology Park At IIT (UTP), which 250 people attended, including Mayor Richard M. Daley, other local politicians, and many individuals from the technology community. Several of those present said they never could have imagined something like this happening in this part of town.Building UTP was a huge risk because it was possible that no tech companies would have wanted to move into the park. We're confident of filling it, though. We project that by 2014 we will have 2,500 employees in 1.5 million square feet of office space in the park's 15 acres. We now have a dozen technology companies on site that are hiring IIT students and taking advantage of IIT's services to further their business.One of the most distinctive aspects of the park is its integration with IIT's academic programs and vision. Often technology parks are simply real estate deals. The land is further from the campus, and people are focused on the park largely for profit. Sometimes there is not much of a relationship with the university.UTP is organized differently. We want to leverage the resources of the university for the companies and to have the park be a living laboratory for IIT. At the same time, UTP provides a great benefit for the students and faculty who can become personally involved with the companies.Lew understood this when he both created the vision for UTP and supported me through the difficult negotiations to make it a reality. As a result, the university is positioned as a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship for years to come."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/smash-bash-and-renovation-s-r-crown-hall", "content": "In 1997, Krueck and Sexton Architects first became professionally involved with President Lew Collens and IIT by doing a feasibility study for the renovation of S. R. Crown Hall. I can say that Lew has been literally a mover and a shaker who has taken as his own Daniel Burnham's rallying cry, \"Make no little plans.\"In 1955, Mies van der Rohe designed for the IIT campus a landmark building for the College of Architecture. This exceptional structure, Crown Hall, completed in 1956, has been universally praised as an icon of modern architecture, and is known and studied by nearly every architect in the world. Remarkably, 50 years after the doors of the building first opened, it is still being used as a school of architecture.Over time, Crown Hall fell into serious disrepair. There was some refurbishment and glass replacement completed in the 1970s, but 30 years later the structure was seriously deteriorating. Rather than perfection of materials and proportion, rust and cracked glass unfortunately became the strongest character of the building.Under the leadership of Lew, the daunting project of restoring Crown Hall was born. The first step in the renovation was to remove the glass. To kick off the ambitious project and to make it a public event, IIT came up with the striking idea to auction off the opportunity to smash the building's windows. This was not quite the iconoclastic idea that it may seem: these windows were, after all, from the 1970s restoration. So the window smashing became a celebration of Crown Hall and the beginning of restoring it to its former beauty.Smash Bash was a memorable ceremony, at which Lew confidently announced that in a mere 14 weeks Crown Hall would be resurrected. He invited all present to come back and celebrate the restored building.As the architect leading the team of historic preservationists, engineers, and contractors, I almost choked. I knew that doing a kitchen in 14 weeks is a challenge, so what did we get ourselves into by pledging that one of the most important buildings in the country would be completely transformed? But, due in large part to Lew's spirit and his faith in our entire team, Crown Hall was indeed reborn at the end of that summer, in just under 14 weeks. There was never a time when IIT said, \"That's too expensive, let's make it cheaper.\" It was always, \"Let's find the best way to make this work because it is an investment in our future.\"The renovation has given new life to the IIT campus and particularly to the College of Architecture. One of the features of Mies' architecture is that it is precise, minimal, and completely thought-out. To see Crown Hall in a shabby state was dispiriting. Now, in its glory, it signifies again its iconic stature. Architecture students, who will spend up to five years in Crown Hall, will have their vision of space, detail, and light forever influenced by the building. When one \"lives\" in Crown Hall, one experiences how the dawn turns to noon turns to dusk turns to darkness. One understands that communication and sharing knowledge can be open and unobstructed by partitions and walls. One sees the way sun and light and nature and sky interact.What was taught in Crown Hall in the last 50 years has transformed the world. The thousands of students who have come out of the College of Architecture have changed the face of every major city on earth. Mies would surely be pleased that one of his masterworks is still being used, and is secure for the next 50 years. Today it is more vibrant and beautiful than ever, through the leadership of Lew Collens, who had the vision, and then the will to make this vision a reality."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/building-downtown-campus", "content": "My first significant experience with Lew Collens was during the construction of the new Downtown Campus for Chicago-Kent College of Law, which he initiated when he was dean of Chicago-Kent.The strategy was simple. Moving the school to a larger, state-of-the-art, computer-friendly building in the West Loop would allow Chicago-Kent to achieve its potential. Our firm, Power Construction, was chosen as the contractor for the building, located at Jefferson and Adams.The rest is history.As dean, Lew often visited the job site to observe the progress. True to his management style, he never intruded on the process. He attended all the major events, such as the groundbreaking, the topping-out, and the dedication ceremonies. Power Construction was the builder, but Lew was the \"boss.\" He put his trust in our firm and then stepped aside to let us do the job.Since then, Chicago-Kent has grown in the number and quality of students. The average LSAT score of the incoming class has increased. Its reputation likewise has been elevated, both in terms of its higher academic standards and the increase in students coming from outside the Chicago area. Today, Chicago-Kent is among the premier law schools in the Midwest.In 1993, Stuart School of Business moved to Downtown Campus. With that move, Stuart has experienced rising enrollment and the growth and success of such programs as the top-ranked Financial Markets program.The facility we built with Lew's guidance has been the home for that growth. In retrospect, the decision to expand to the West Loop was truly visionary considering how this area has developed in the past 16 years. The Downtown Campus is centrally located in a vibrant mixed-use market. Students and faculty have immediate access to employers and other resources located in downtown Chicago.As with many of his later decisions, Lew exhibited foresight in this major commitment, confirming to all of us that he was the right man for the right job at the right time. For many years to come, IIT will reap the benefits of his decisions and accomplishments."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/why-robert-pritzker-and-i-made-our-large-gifts-university-1996", "content": "There were two main reasons why Robert Pritzker and I made our large gifts to the university in 1996. It started with our spirit of confidence that in President Lew Collens, IIT had the prospect of real leadership. This leadership proved to be the reality, for which we felt there would be achievability should we make a healthy investment of funds in the university.Second, Bob Pritzker and I have always been of the mind that people who teach at IIT as well as a very large number of students have a strong backbone in terms of getting things done, and an understanding of the utility of a good education once you get it. At Motorola, to name just one example, there were a number of people who came out of IIT who were very practical engineers and effective managers, including two former presidents of the company.There were many good professors and administrators who talked about moving the university forward. We thought that if we could dream up a general strategy for the institution, that it would be very helpful for the long-term health of the institution. This desire led to the National Commission for IIT, in which the outcomes became the thinking of pretty sage people.At this point, we were confident that we had a strong base of leadership and planning at the institution, and knew that there needed to be financial support to help those changes happen.Bob and I didn't negotiate tangibly to each give IIT a figure of $60 million. We just thought, \"These are common-sense goals that ought to be achieved, if the institution has the resources.\" Lew wasn't afraid of taking a chance, Bob Pritzker wasn't afraid, and my approach to many things is that we should try it as long as it does not involve jumping off a cliff.The three of us did spend upwards of a half-dozen times together before announcing our gifts, building our mutual confidence based on ideas from the commission. Basically, we sold ourselves that it was a good thing.Bob was initially a more encouraging person with regard to the size of the gift. It didn't take me long to get used to it. All those numbers get pretty big, you know, and I was willing to follow Bob's good guidance.We had a good mutual building of our troika confidence, and there were other people around us, including Trustee Al Self, who gave important input. Other people also were very confident that all these goals were worth the try\u2014and that IIT would become one of the best universities in the Chicago area.Bob and I had come to the proposition that gifts in the range of $50 million from each were going to be necessary. That would add up to $100 million. One of the thoughts that one of us suggested was that others should match our gifts. That would lead to $200 million, which is very good.But in the course of our deliberations, we said, \"Let's not play this thing too short. Let's do something incrementally more.\" What is an increment? If we put in $10 million more each, that gave us $120 million. Add a matching campaign, and you get $250 million, which sounded better. In other words, if we each put in $60 million, we could go for a quarter of a billion dollars. It was one of those loose arithmetic situations.Pretty soon, we just looked each other and said, \"If your family is going to give $60 million, our family is going to give $60 million. Let's see if we can get some other people behind us to raise another $130 million.\"Other people helped us in exceeding the $250 million goal we had set. Since then, the university has made tremendous strides, and is poised to do even bigger things going forward."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/financing-and-building-state-street-village", "content": "The State Street Village (SSV) student residence emerged as part of IIT's effort to provide state-of-the-art housing for students while improving the appearance of Main Campus along the State Street corridor.Before SSV was built, undergraduates only had one option for living arrangements in McCormick Student Village, where two students occupied a room and there was one shared bathroom per hall. This meant that there were more than 30 students using the same bathroom! Although this was typical of student housing 40 years ago, President Lew Collens recognized the need to expand and improve student-housing options. He stressed the importance of this and was committed to supporting an innovative approach to accomplishing the new project.SSV gave students two additional options\u2014suite-style setups, each with two double-bed rooms connected by a common bathroom, and apartment setups, where each unit has its own bathroom, living room area, and kitchen. The building also has a fantastic rooftop deck attached to a communal lounge. The deck offers a panoramic view of downtown Chicago. This was a dramatic expression of\u00a0the university's commitment to provide state-of-the-art housing for students.Lew strongly encouraged and supported an innovative strategy for financing the project. We formed a new 501c(3) not-for-profit organization called State Street Corporation, an independent corporation, with the sole mission to support housing at IIT. The corporation issued bonds that were supported by revenue from State Street Village.Four years after opening, SSV, along with The McCormick Tribune Campus Center (MTCC), continues to bring national recognition to IIT. Standing side-by-side, the buildings are dramatic and compatible.Having the award-winning architect Helmut Jahn design SSV has further elevated IIT's position as a leading campus of architectural significance\u2014a position the university originally achieved through the work of Mies van der Rohe.In addition to creating 367 additional beds for freshmen and upperclassmen, SSV has provided incoming freshmen more housing options, thereby appealing to the new crop of prospective students. Partially as a result of both SSV and MTCC, enrollment at IIT, and in the College of Architecture in particular, continues to increase."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/designing-and-implementing-main-campus-master-plan", "content": "There was a growing sentiment in the early 1990s that IIT's Main Campus was struggling amidst the surrounding public housing projects. Some people on the Board of Trustees were saying that we should shut down the campus and move to the suburbs.Inspired by President Lew Collens, who has always been committed to Main Campus and Chicago, there was a group of us that said, \"This is Chicago. It's just a matter of improving the situation. We can do it.\"To address the issue, Lew and the board asked me to develop some ideas about how to make the campus not only safe, but also a more attractive place. Our recommendations included a reduction in the width of State Street, more landscaping, and traffic-calming measures such as signage and lighting. The plan also proposed building a new campus center and student housing along the El tracks to reduce the noise from the CTA trains. We believed that these expansions and improvements would make this campus a much more attractive environment.Many of the buildings that Mies van der Rohe designed are well known, and certainly many of them needed to be preserved and protected.\u00a0 Our recommendations for the landmarking of the important buildings have been implemented. Both the landscaping of Main Campus and the execution of the Master Plan have won major architectural awards, and S. R. Crown Hall has been named a National Historic Landmark.Today, a decade later, there are many other positive developments in the area around the university, including improved housing and more people and businesses moving into the neighborhood.It seems as if the decision to stay and develop Main Campus was the right one."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/mccormick-tribune-campus-center", "content": "In the early 1990s, IIT Main Campus was hardly the image of a respected landmark. The landscape was uninspiring, and a sea of surface parking under the El created a barren, unfriendly zone between the academic and residential parts of campus.Keeping in step with the National Commission for IIT recommendations to visually improve the campus environment, a team of in-house talent proposed to President Lew Collens a competition to build a campus center. We felt a new building would help to aesthetically enhance the campus while also providing a place for the IIT community to congregate.Lew championed the idea. He wanted a campus center that would not only change people's minds about IIT's location, but also send a message of our commitment to both Main Campus and the State Street renovation.To initiate the open competition, we sent a letter of invitation to 56 firms around the world that represented all generations of architectural thinking. The five finalists comprised a very international group, with architects based in Rotterdam, Tokyo, Chicago, New York, and London.The Richard H. Driehaus Foundation funded this aspect of the competition. Its sponsorship boosted the contest's prestige, and the stipend allowed some candidates who otherwise might not have applied to do so. Each of them was given $25,000 and allowed two to three months to execute a design.All of the finalists submitted a plan, which they presented to the jury\u2014a five-person group that included alumni, academics, and practitioners\u2014who in turn recommended a design to the Board of Trustees Facility Committee and Lew.The jury's selection was a very deliberative process. We received two very strong entries, which led to a deadlock between the two schemes and a last-minute emergency meeting with the Board of Trustees Facilities Committee to break the tie. I recall Robert Pritzker reminding us that competitions were about finding a winner\u2014that we must find a winner.Rem Koolhaas, an award-winning Dutch architect who gained fame in the architecture world for his theory and for blurring the lines between urban design and architecture, was that winner. Ultimately, what pushed his design over the top was that it addressed student needs and was very student-oriented.On opening day Mayor Richard M. Daley visited IIT, and we held a big opening-night party. Many prominent people in the architecture world attended, including the chair of the architecture program at Harvard, who had told Lew at the contest's inception that it was the most important architecture contest of the last half-century.Mayor Daley cut the ribbon, and the speeches were delivered from the top of the stairs above the Center Court dining area. Koolhaas attended and greeted guests as he stood at his favorite spot in the building, the top of the western stairs of Center Court. I believe he liked this spot so much because it's possible to see all the pathways in the MTCC from that juncture and to survey the whole building.While the campus community had reveled in the competition, and was now celebrating the debut of the MTCC, it's important to remember how big a risk this project was for Lew. He remained committed to the building, even early on when financing had not been secured. The project garnered the university a great deal of media attention, so failure would have been a disaster. Because Lew remained dogged and helped to obtain gifts from the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which enabled matching gifts through the IIT Challenge Campaign, we were able to finish the project.In hindsight, building the MTCC has been an enormous success in terms of bringing together the IIT community. In the previous student center you could often count on two or three hands the number of students that would be there on a Friday afternoon. Today it is easy to see a real sense of community.There have been other benefits, too.The College of Architecture has seen a major boost in enrollment, and I am convinced that the MTCC has helped with admissions recruitment in general. It also has spurred a tremendous influx of visitors to Main Campus.Indeed, the MTCC is one of the city's great new buildings, and its impact, along with the other elements of the Main Campus Master Plan, has been transformative for IIT."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/expanding-overseas-iit-india", "content": "President Lew Collens has always been supportive of the university's international expansion, which was a recommendation of the National Commission for IIT. So when Motorola contacted me in 1996 to see if IIT could offer master's degree programs to its employees in Bangalore, India's \"Silicon Valley,\" I was confident Lew would want us to try.Motorola wanted to give its top performing employees in India the opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills without leaving India. IIT already offered master's programs to suburban working professionals through IITV, the William F. Finkl Interactive Instructional Network, which transmitted courses via microwave to company sites within a 40-mile radius of downtown.In 1997, we began offering master's degrees in computer science and a master's in telecommunications and software engineering in Bangalore. Initially, we sent videotapes to Bangalore via air courier. Students submitted homework via email or ftp. Occasionally, we held videoconferences.The Internet offered the potential to deliver courses anywhere, anytime. Motorola provided seed funding to expand that effort. Within a few years, classes in Bangalore were delivered entirely via streamed video on the Internet. Today, 24 hours after professors deliver their lectures in Chicago, IIT Online posts them on the Internet. Even working professionals who travel can access the courses. And students everywhere are held to the same standards as students in the Chicago sections.At first, five companies participated. Today, 15 companies in India have employees enrolled in our master's programs. Companies tell us that this initiative helps them recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Some companies have commercialized ideas their employees developed in their IIT classes.Offering courses in Bangalore helped to spark a dramatic increase in enrollment of Indian students at IIT in Chicago. In 1997, only 250 Indian students were enrolled here. Within a few years, enrollment of Indian students here more than doubled. By 2001, IIT was the No. 1 destination for Indian graduate students applying for United States visas. Today, 1,100 students from India and a total of 2,300 international students are registered for courses in Chicago. These students add a lot of revenue to the university. They also contribute to the base of this country because many of them stay here after they graduate and give back to our society.Furthermore, these students also extend the globalization of IIT as a quality academic institution and enhance the multicultural vibrancy of the university.We now offer degree programs in five other cities\u2014Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune. Because we offer the same rigorous courses in India that we do in Chicago, IIT is very respected there. We were the first and only U.S. university approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to operate in India.We are very proud of the program because it has been quite successful in both building awareness of IIT and helping us better serve students and employers."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/new-focus-institute-psychology", "content": "Prior to President Lew Collens' arrival in 1990, some people thought of the Psychology department as primarily supporting undergraduate course requirements, not knowing that it had a history of graduating more Ph.D.s than any other departmentin the university.That changed after the National Commission for IIT. The university community embraced the idea that IIT's academic identity would be better served by organizing around its strengths in professional training rather than emphasizing the traditional undergraduate degrees.In 1995, the Psychology department was elevated to an institute. Since then we have continued to graduate more Ph.D. students than any other department at IIT. More importantly, however, our Rehabilitation Counseling program achieved and is holding its spot in the Top 5 of theranking.

With Lew's encouragement in 1998, we officially opened the Center for Research and Service, which consults to industry on human-resource measurement, selection, and career counseling, with multiple opportunities to employ students on projects.Once the strength of our graduate program was recognized and we received the opportunity to explore its potential for growth, the institute has been able to truly flourish.

It's grown into a substantive undergraduate major and a doctoral program that is going to create very strong areas of research. Already, the research expenditures are the most per faculty member of any department in the engineering school.In addition to supporting this new venture, Lew developed the resources for the renovation of Wishnick Hall, which was an important part of the restoration of the Mies van der Rohe buildings. Today, we have four renovated teaching labs in Wishnick, 15 faculty offices, and an office suite for a new chair of the department. Also, the newly hired faculty have been installed in state-of-the-art research labs in the Engineering Research Building, part of University Technology Park At IIT (UTP). We've grown rapidly into this new space, which supports our academic and research efforts; this required a great deal of funds for the renovation, and Lew made the investment.Thanks to his commitment of financial resources, we now have a home for Biomedical Engineering.In addition, plans are currently underway to build significant facilities for the Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering in UTP. The centers established under the Pritzker Institute will help enhance the partnership with the University of Chicago and other medical centers in Chicago.The path of the future is through interdisciplinary efforts. Lew has led the way through the Interprofessional Projects program and by encouraging disciplines such as biomedical engineering, which is inherently interactive across fields in biology and engineering. The Pritzker Institute has areas of medical imaging, diabetes, and neural imaging. These involve Biomedical Engineering faculty as well as numerous faculty members in science and engineering across campus.Our research is thriving due to collaborations, quality facilities, and a strongly supported interdisciplinary approach; Biomedical Engineering and the Pritzker Institute at IIT are well positioned to make highly significant contributions to the field thanks to the vision and foresight of Lew Collens."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/camras-scholars-program", "content": "Ten years ago as a high school senior in Anchorage, Alaska,with good grades and test scores, I was deeply involved in my search to find the \"perfect\" college\u2014one that would educate as well as inspire me. One of my teachers gave me a brochure for the Camras program, which provided students full-tuition scholarships to attend IIT. If I qualified, IIT would pay the travel expenses for me to visit campus during Camras Weekend to interview for the scholarship.I had never heard of IIT, but the opportunity sounded great to this ambitious 18-year-old. Fortunately, I qualified, flew from Alaska for an interview, and fell in love with both Chicago and the university.During Camras Weekend, the IIT undergraduates really impressed me as they proudly showed me around \"their\" campus. I also had a strong connection to the other students being interviewed. My fellow Camras applicants were from very diverse social and economic backgrounds, were at the top of their class, and were active in several organizations at their high schools. I instantly knew that I wanted to be a part of this group.Once I was offered a Camras Scholarship, I accepted immediately. I had been considering quite a few schools on the East Coast, but that ended after I heard from IIT. It was a great scholarship, and a wonderful school.My fellow graduates and I are going places because of the Camras program.At IIT, we were met with challenging courses and opportunities to explore ourselves through numerous student groups. Above all, we were required to perform academically if we wanted to keep the scholarship. Some of us got involved in research early as undergraduates. If there was an idea we wanted to explore, we could do it. The opportunities as a Camras student were endless.The Camras program has had a big impact on the makeup of IIT's student body. Apart from being among the best and brightest high school graduates, Camras scholars come from all over the country, whereas most of IIT students historically have come from the Midwest. And even though IIT is a technical university that has drawn mostly men, many of the former and current Camras scholars are women.There has been a positive boost in school spirit. Bringing in new athletic programs contributed to a certain extent, but the Camras program made a difference, too. This was apparent when Camras students would host prospective scholars during their visits to campus. When I visited IIT for the first time, I saw current students who were involving themselves in helping new people and hosting prospectives because they love IIT. Their great sense of pride in their university community was very apparent and infectious. In turn, I hosted students whenever I could.While the Camras program has attracted students who are dedicated academically, they also have a unique sense of humor. At graduation, one of my Camras friends hooked a motor to his graduation cap and had the tassle spin around, while another had some LEDs on his cap illuminated!One of the benefits of being a Camras scholar was joining the other scholarship recipients for dinner at the home of Robert Pritzker. We all felt honored, as first-year Camras students, to be invited to such an event. The dinner was an occasion when we felt the privilege of being Camras scholars and empowered to be successful like Mr. Pritzker.It also was an honor simply to be part of a program named for Marvin Camras, an important inventor who pioneered magnetic tape recording and served on the faculty of IIT.I've kept in touch with many of my Camras friends, emailing, talking, and even meeting with them for vacations in Cabo San Lucas. One of my friends is an engineer for NASA. She had never flown on a plane before she went to IIT for her Camras interview; now she flies around the world. Another friend just got her professional engineer's license, and a third teaches at Notre Dame.I have worked most recently for 3M Alaska as a sales account representative, selling a wide variety of 3M safety and security products to a diverse customer base. I often work with engineers on specifications for building materials, consult on proper applications of my products, and conduct training. It is a wonderful job that builds directly on the training I received at IIT. My job allows meto explore more of my home state and to interact with customers to find innovative solutions to their technical problems.In short, my fellow graduates and I are going places, and much of it is because of the Camras program. I am very grateful to President Lew Collens for his leadership in promoting and initiating this program, which means the world to those of us who have experienced it."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/teaching-better-teachers-forming-mathematics-and-science-education-department", "content": "An early vision of IIT was to give back to the local community by preparing teachers to teach science and math in the surrounding Bronzeville area.During my initial discussions with IIT prior to joining the university, I stressed that IIT needed to have comprehensive master's and Ph.D. programs in science and mathematics education. I knew that the biggest market for our Mathematics and Science Education (MSED) department would be teachers already in the area who would be looking to develop professionally.President Lew Collens shared this vision.With two faculty members and nine students, we offered our first class in spring 2002.Since then, we've had a variety of successful programs, some with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and some that extend further. We have a National Science Foundation grant with Western Michigan University and a variety of other projects where we evaluate grants at other organizations, such as the Brookfield Zoo and the University of Illinois.Although there are no official national rankings, our peers view the MSED department very highlydue to the esteem in which our faculty and graduates are held.Our faculty have been on the board of directors of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching and the National Science Teachers Association, and have edited scholarly journals. Another distinguishing factor is that all of our faculty are former teachers; we will not interview people who have not taught in public schools. Since we educate teachers, we want to make sure our faculty are experienced in this area of instruction.We have 44 Ph.D. students, which makes us the biggest Ph.D. program on campus. Seventy percent of our doctoral students work in CPS. Two of our Ph.D. students have graduated: one is working at Loyola University, the other at Roosevelt University.The growth of our department is impressive given our short time in existence, and is a tribute to my colleagues, our students, and Lew's commitment.We have forged collaborative relationships overseas\u2014research projects or faculty exchanges\u2014that involve the Stockholm Institute in Sweden, the University of Hong Kong, and National Chang Hua University in Taiwan, among others.But our collaboration is local as well as global.For example, we have a post-secondary education grant with the Biomedical Engineering department in conjunction with The Biotechnology Institute in Virginia. We also are working with members of the Applied Mathematics department on co-sponsoring a Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics.As designed, our biggest program today is our master's program. Today, we have about 80 students, and true to the original vision of IIT, a large proportion of them are CPS teachers in Bronzeville.Lew has been, from day one, the most supportive administrator at any level with whom I've ever worked. My prior experience was that if the president phoned to talk to me, I must have done something wrong. When Lew calls, it's about something he's heard or read, and he wants to know if there is anything that can be applied at IIT.I always take his calls."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/leadership-academy", "content": "Hand-in-hand with providing a robust academic experience, IIT has exhibited a growing commitment to developing the leadership strengths of its students. Through the Leadership Academy, which opened in 1998, our students are better equipped to advance to positions of leadership while as students and in their professional careers.IIT has exhibited a growing commitment to developing the leadership strengths of its students.The academy has had a great impact on all students and on how IIT is perceived in the marketplace. I have always appreciated President Lew Collens' support for the academy and his role in cultivating the donors who funded this program. I am grateful for the generous contributions of Trustee Al Self and his wife, Lila, as well as John Mitchell (EE '50), which enabled us to found the academy.There are two levels of involvement among students. The first is the 25 Academy Scholars\u2014the number has grown from 20 when it started\u2014who receive a scholarship to fund their entire education. These are the best student-leaders at IIT.The second level includes leadership retreats and seminars, which we offer to all undergraduates, not only to the academy scholars. On average, 150\u2013200 students participate in them, which is nearly double the attendees from when we started. Lew is always right there, too, hiking and playing horseshoes with the students, encouraging them to test their potential.The program has inspired a number of students to be more involved in activities on campus, within the country, and in other countries. A number of organizations initiated and managed by students got their start in the academy.Engineers Without Borders (EWB), which does similar work as Doctors Without Borders, is one of them. Right now, EWB is working on infrastructure improvement in Haiti. EWB also collaborated with Habitat for Humanity to rebuild houses destroyed during Hurricane Katrina."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2007/head-games", "content": "Humans have a startling ability to extract meaning from words. For most, a facility with written and spoken language is second nature by adolescence. Readingon the other hand\u2014deciphering the non-verbal, often unconscious signals they send out\u2014is a highly specialized talent, one that Andrew Rubin (Ph.D. PSYC '01) has honed to an uncanny degree.In the course of his career in clinical psychology, Rubin has become keenly attuned to facial and bodily intimations in his patients, drawing on a silent storehouse of emotional data to help children and adults. Today, his thriving Florida practice assists those with infant and childhood development issues, couples facing relational problems, and those grappling with depression.But don't expect much empathy should you encounter Rubin across a poker table. There, his people-reading prowess is likely to be used against you. Indeed, Dr. Drew, \"The Poker Ph.D.\" (as ESPN announcers dubbed him), has a deadly knack for reading tells\u2014subtle clues players give regarding the cards they hold. This ability has earned Rubin \"casino cred\" from seasoned pros, not to mention more than a quarter-million dollars in prize winnings.Rubin's fascination with psychology lured him to IIT, where he earned his doctorate in clinical psychology. It was an experience Rubin recalls with deep fondness: \"IIT was a wonderful learning environment, and Robert Schleser was one of the greatest mentors a person could ever have,\" he says, referring to his advisor at the Institute of Psychology.An obsession with poker, however, didn't blossom until his post-grad days. Rubin found himself at, where an old IIT buddy, Lorenzo Azzi (Ph.D. PSYC '01), was interning. Amid their academic studies, the two psychologist friends took up poker\u2014first casually, soon with ferocious determination. \"Drew and I are very competitive,\" Azzi says, adding that both also were strong athletes. \"As we got older, our bodies didn't allow us to compete at our previous levels. So we gravitated toward another area where we felt we had an edge on our opponents,\" he adds with a laugh.\"If you look at all the successful players who make it to the final tables over and over again,\" Rubin insists, \"their ability to read other players is a significant factor.\"New Orleans' thriving assortment of gambling dens and riverboat casinos provided an ideal second campus for the pair. After making the evening rounds, the two would often stay up for hours playing one-on-one poker and honing their skills.Rubin also was digesting poker books with a near-insatiable appetite, though he found the art and science of reading tells inadequately explored. This was particularly true with respect to his game of choice\u2014Texas Hold 'Em, a lively poker variant that has recently become a national sensation. \"If you look at all the successful players who make it to the final tables over and over again,\" Rubin insists, \"their ability to read other players is a significant factor.\" Having mastered all fundamentals of the game, he undertook a comprehensive study of poker's often-elusive psychological aspects, in particular, the decryption of tells.The traditional poker face\u2014a blank slate leeched of emotional affect\u2014is for poker zealots like Rubin a treasure trove of information. As he explains, two broad species of tells exist: those the player emits subconsciously and those used deliberately to mislead the opponent, what in common parlance are known as bluffs. \"What I study are the autonomic responses when people pick up a hand,\" Rubin says. Such signals include dilation of the pupils, increased breathing, perspiration, and other manifestations of anxiety.The technique has correlates in other fields, notably law enforcement, where autonomic clues suggestive of deception are used in criminal interviews. In psychology, such non-verbal behavioral cues also may prove critical, as Rubin elaborates: \"I use it every day in my clinical practice. You can tell if patients are distressed, if they're being disingenuous, if they're nervous,\" he says.At the highest levels of play, relentless intelligence gathering is the order of the day. \"Every single round I want to pick up something on the players,\" Rubin maintains. \"The way they bet their chips, how they look at their cards\u2014you never know when you're going to detect something that's going to come in handy.\"Rubin's supreme attentiveness paid off in spades (or rather, in aces) at the 2006. \"It was my very first World Series event. I was a little stressed going in there,\" he remembers. In one of the late rounds, with tension mounting, Rubin found himself seated at a table with Jennifer Harman, one of the world's top players.Rubin is animated in recounting the magical moment that turned the tables for him during that game: \"I had one hand against Jennifer, with three tables left. It was a huge hand,\" he remembers. It was at this moment his near-clairvoyant ability to read tells eased him into the winner's circle.\"I actually recognized Jennifer's tell from watching her on television,\" he says. Her tell revealed that Harman also had a very strong hand (ace, king, it turned out) and might be enticed to go all in, that is, to bet all of her chips. Having read Harman's unconscious tell, Rubin responded with a purposeful tell designed to imply that he was tentative about his next move.The tactic worked. Confident of her superior strength, Harman pushed all her chips to the center of the table, only to see Dr. Drew uncover pocket aces, the strongest hand in poker. Having relieved Harman of all of her cash in one stunning hand, Rubin went on to the final table and a $264,000 win.Ron Rubens, poker shark and co-founder of, a training ground for aspiring champs, remembers Rubin's hand well. \"Because he was able to pick up the tell, he was able to securely set a trap. One read like that in a tournament can make the difference between going home with nothing and going home with several hundred thousand dollars,\" he says. \"In Drew's particular case, that's exactly what happened.\"Not surprisingly, Rubens decided to tap Dr. Drew's powers of perception, inviting him to play and teach his skills during the championship round of the Spring World Poker Tour in Reno. For three days, The Poker Ph.D. acted as the Boot Camp's tell-reading guru-in-residence, wrapping up the exciting event with a third place finish in the WPT Championship.Happily preoccupied with his clinical practice and busy family life these days, Rubin has no plans to hit the road hustling poker full-time, though his enthrallment with the game is undiminished: \"I really like the intellectual challenges of poker. It's understanding the statistics of the hands that you play, understanding position, being able to read other players' everything in combination makes it fascinating for me.\"The autonomic nervous system has evolved to protect humans in hostile settings.As Andrew Rubin notes, \"In a stressful or dangerous situation your blood pressure increases. Your heart rate increases. You\u00a0get a burst of energy, and your eyes dilate to make you more aware of your environment. Without this delicate system,\" he observes, \"humans might have failed to survive as a species.\"For those properly attuned, such telltale signs of anxiety or stress may be used to an advantage, particularly in the game of poker.\"It's very difficult to cover up when you hit a big hand,\" notes Rubin. \"Your blood pressure goes up and the first thing that happens as you try to manipulate the chips is your hand starts trembling.\" He instructs novice poker players: \"always watch people's hands!\"\"Where your opponent places his chips can make a big difference. People do a lot of unconscious things,\" Rubin adds. \"For instance, he may push those chips far away from him and put them in the middle of the table if he feels they may not be coming back. If he thinks he has a big hand he may not place them as far away.\"When a player casts a glance at his or her chips after looking at their hand, this is usually an inadvertent sign their hand is strong. \"Even before I look at my cards, I'm watching everyone else look at their chips,\" Rubin says.The most general rule of thumb in reading tells deliberately designed to mislead is that players attempt to look strong when they are weak and weak when they hold a strong hand. These conscious gestures, which poker players refer to as acting, tend to be splashier and less subtle than tells emitted unconsciously. A player who sighs at his cards or speaks with exaggerated hesitancy or a tenor of resignation is often concealing a big hand."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2007/interprofessional-projects-program", "content": "It was an idea that was ahead of its time.In the mid-'90s, many universities began to respond to what industry leaders were telling them about college graduates: that they needed a more holistic education and the ability to communicate and be broad thinkers.President Lew Collens was listening.Then Vice President and Provost Hassan Nagib proposed to Lew an idea for a program that would elevate the traditional capstone course. This new program would assemble larger teams of 5\u201320 students who would address bigger, more complex problems while learning valuable workplace skills. Projects would team faculty from across the university, and a champion from a single department would drive each project. This idea echoed the recommendations of the National Commission for IIT, which stressed the importance of distinguishing IIT's academic program.The Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) program launched in spring 1995. Nagib was the lead faculty member of the initial project, which dealt with the range of technical, economic, political, and social issues associated with the future of high-speed rail in the United States.In the early days of IPRO, few of us faculty members had experience with interdisciplinary work. In time I have come to appreciate the efforts of the IPRO office to inspire new thinking, as well as the responsiveness of the faculty. The faculty have grown professionally by incorporating others' perspectives and work with their own, and by increasingly exploring collaborative research opportunities at the boundaries of the professions where it is recognized that significant innovation occurs.Today, IPRO is a truly unique program, in large part due to the many innovative ways that the courses are delivered. It also is distinct because IIT requires all undergraduates to take IPRO, whereas most other universities make similar programs available only through particular majors or on a voluntary basis.Faculty from throughout the university are invited to propose topics. We also make sure that a diverse group of students participate in each course. Sponsorship also plays an important role, with 25\u201330 percent of the teams receiving sponsorship from companies such as Motorola or the Chicago White Sox. These sponsoring organizations, including industry leaders and alumni, call on students to research a complex and multifaceted topic, oftentimes on behalf of their companies or to augment their own research endeavors.In offering IPRO, IIT was on the cutting edge. Now IIT is, to some extent, a leader in the field of interdisciplinary education.The topics covered range from \"edutainment,\" applying electronic game methods to improving learning effectiveness, to accurately monitoring the respiration rate for those afflicted with asthma. Twice per year the university holds IPRO Day events, where teams present their work and are evaluated by faculty, professionals, and other students. IPRO topics usually carry over from semester to semester and year to year, allowing a new crop of students to build upon and advance an idea generated by an earlier group, with projects often taking social, political, or economic dimensions.With its interdisciplinary and practical emphasis, IPRO was\u2014and still is\u2014a progressive approach to education. For example, the sole accrediting body for engineering and technology programs in the United States is the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). In 2000, ABET transitioned from its old criteria to what it called ABET 2000. One of the fundamental distinctions of the new ABET 2000 was an explicit requirement for multidisciplinary teamwork. In offering IPRO, IIT was on the cutting edge. Now IIT is, to some extent, a leader in the field of interdisciplinary education.While Lew's intent with IPRO was to improve the academic experience for students, both IPRO and EnPRO have given back much to the university. Today, the disciplines join much more organically, and faculty and students learn from each other.The projects have been extremely impressive. KlarAqua, a sustainable, low-cost water purification system, is just one such example. In the project, students drew upon the work of Nasrin Khalili, an Environmental Management faculty member, who had developed a concept for improving clay filters used to purify water in remote villages. Students integrated readily available buckets, locally made clay pots, and other available materials into an economical system that improves the efficiency and quality of water filtration at the local family level in such areas as rural Mexico.In 2006, KlarAqua won first place and a prize of $15,000 for being the most innovative and socially responsible design at the Social Entrepreneurship Idea to Product competition.IPRO has benefited the university on multiple levels. It has enabled us to surpass accrediting requirements; during our last ABET visit, the board identified IPRO as one of the strongest features of the IIT curriculum. The North Central Association echoed this in its more recent university-wide accreditation of IIT. And because students mention their IPRO experience when they interview for jobs, professionals who recruit and work with our graduates are increasingly aware of IIT's academic programs and special approach in preparing students to make substantive contributions in cross-functional team organization environments.In 2001, Lew approached Board of Trustees member Ed Kaplan (ME '65) about helping to expand IPRO to create the concept of Entrepreneurial Projects (EnPRO) as a special component of the IPRO program.An EnPRO tweaks the IPRO project focus, stimulating students to learn business skills by developing an idea for market. In an EnPRO, students evaluate the technical and business feasibility of a new venture idea, build prototypes, gain user feedback, and eventually formulate a business plan to explore the financial opportunity for starting a business.The students have shown real enthusiasm for EnPRO. One creative project developed a system whereby capable tailors in places such as India, where individual craftsmen are being displaced by larger operations, are provided jobs making clothes for customers who place orders online.Every year the IPRO program continues to improve. We are developing a new course sequence in team leadership and project management, with an initial focus on service learning team leadership. Supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, this project will work to create a formal service-learning experience within the IPRO program that incorporates best practices, in association with Purdue University's Engineering Projects in Community Service Program.Recently, IIT held a national conference about best practices in interdisciplinary team project programs, presenting IPRO as a model approach that is distinctive. Dozens of universities participated. The conference demonstrated how far the program has come, and how it has achieved national prominence.On a personal level, I have especially enjoyed the international service learning aspect of IPRO, which has afforded me wonderful new teaching experiences.A few years ago one of my IPRO teams went to El Salvador for a week. It was a very diverse group, with students representing a number of different majors and backgrounds, including an architecture student of Asian-American descent who had grown up in a small town in Africa where her father was a practicing physician.We spent five days teaching a course on treating spinal deformities such as scoliosis with orthoses in El Salvador at Don Bosco University, the only internationally accredited orthotic and prosthetic education program in Latin America. About a dozen of our students teamed up with students from Don Bosco University to provide treatment for patients who participated in the course.One of our students, Elizabeth, had ambitions to become a doctor. As I divided the students into groups with their patients, I handed her some X-rays and said, \"This is your patient.\"Her eyes bugging out, she said, \"Professor Meade, I'm so scared.\"\"Why?\" I asked.\"I don't want to screw it up.\"Now, Elizabeth is finishing medical school.I went there to teach biomechanics and left very humbled. It's a very powerful experience. I'm grateful that we can offer such opportunities to our students.While Lew's intent with IPRO was to improve the academic experience for students, both IPRO and EnPRO have given back much to the university. It has made our students more attractive to employers while exposing us to organizations that might otherwise not have heard of IIT. And, for some of us, it's pushed us to teach and learn in a more flexible and fluid manner than we had previously. Today, the disciplines join much more organically, and faculty and students learn from each other."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/financial-growth", "content": "When I joined IIT in 1994, it was in the midst of a long-range planning effort, the National Commission for IIT.

Many laud his administration as one of the high points for the university, and his fundraising efforts solidified a school otherwise struggling under its own financial weight.Today, the study in his home looks just as one might expect: numerous achievements and degrees decorate the wall, with mementos of students, faculty, trustees, and friends placed throughout, and files storing annual reports and newspaper clippings chronicle his time in office.One thing stands out, though\u2014there is no computer. A pioneer from a technical university, and he doesn't even own a computer. But for John Theodore Rettaliata, not needing a computer to keep track of life is somehow fitting.Rettaliata became president of IIT in 1952 at age 40\u2014the youngest IIT president to date and, at the time, the youngest chief executive of a scientific school in the United States. Chosen from a field of 75 candidates, Rettaliata succeeded Henry Heald and held the position for 21 years. During his tenure, he saw Main Campus built,added,founded, and IIT grow to be the biggest engineering school in the United States. IIT historians call this a 'golden age' for the university, and for good reason. Between the innovative cooperative education program\u2014one of the first in the nation\u2014and Rettaliata's national influence as he testified before Congress on numerous occasions, Illinois Tech (the common nickname back then) held a high position in the ranks of the nation's technological universities. While it was Mies van der Rohe's design that made Main Campus the historical landmark it is today, Rettaliata's vision made the university a leader in education.Most current IIT students, staff, and faculty have never met Rettaliata, and some may have never heard his name. In fact, Rettaliata hasn't been back to IIT since his resignation in 1973. Why has such an influential figure in IIT history stayed away for so long?\"I visited other schools while on accreditation boards, and some of them would have the former president there on campus in an office. The faculty would call and tell the former president what the new guy wasn't doing right,\"\u00a0Rettaliata says. \"I wanted to let the new guy do his job.\"Now 94, Rettaliata reflects on the accomplishments of his professional career, whether as an engineer, educator, or executive. Before coming to IIT, he worked for, a leading manufacturing company in the Midwest. During World War II, he embarked on the first of many roles for the United States government, taking part in the tour of British aeronautical research facilities that enabled America to develop a better jet aircraft. As such, in 1943, he became one of the first people to fly in a jet aircraft. When Nazi Germany fell, the Navy Bureau of Ships sent him to Germany to investigate an innovative hydrogen-peroxide submarine\u2014a project he completed alone and filed a confidential report on. He continued to consult for the Navy after the war, helping with the development of gas turbine applications and, according to a 1953 article in Popular Science, other projects for the Air Force that were at the time 'still secret.'While president at IIT, Rettaliata held a seat on the National Advisory Council on Aeronautics, and then was appointed to the National Aeronautics and Space Council, the planning body of the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Attending bi-monthly meetings in the White House, Rettaliata says he was most impressed with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who, despite popular opinion to the contrary, had a good grasp of the highly technical topics being discussed. After leaving the university in 1973, he became chair of the board of Banca di Roma in Chicago and later served on the boards of Admiral, Amsted Industries, Brunswick, DeSoto Chemical, First Federal Savings, Harris Bank, International Harvester, SC Johnson, Kemper Insurance, Peabody Energy, Santa Fe Railway, and Western Electric.Still, if you heard it from him, you'd think his successes were no big deal. Rettaliata's primary accomplishment at IIT, the construction of Main Campus, was one of necessity, but not for the reasons many believe today, he says. When it came to bringing in faculty, Rettaliata certainly had the connections, but no amount of praise over the phone could keep them here once they arrived for a tour. The problem was IIT's neighborhood, with run-down apartment buildings lining the 'L' between State and Wabash. With the help of Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, things began to change. By the time Rettaliata left IIT, Main Campus was an almost continuous stretch from LaSalle to Michigan between 30th and 35th, and would remain untouched until 1998. The building of Main Campus and his relationship with Mies, the architect of Main Campus, provided many interesting moments.\"One day,\" he says, \"Mies came into my office and said he wanted to build a building that had never been built before, or at least that he had never built before. The building would be supported all by its roof, and there would be I-beams across the roof to support the weight.\" Rettaliata went out, as he put it, \"to ring some doorbells,\" and soon had the necessary $700,000 to begin work. Henry Crown's doorbell was one that he rang, and Crown agreed to pay for a substantial amount of the building's construction. As the building was being constructed, Mies said he needed more money to finish the project. Rettaliata says he responded with language he wouldn't repeat, but after he rang a few more doorbells, S. R. Crown Hall opened in 1956. In one of the more tender moments in the Rettaliata/Mies relationship, at the dedication of Crown Hall, Mies gave Rettaliata a Gold Key to Crown Hall. The key, which now sits in a case hanging over his desk at home, was a sign of gratitude Rettaliata received from Mies, a man he describes as \"a good man, a modest man,\" who was quiet and private and hated giving speeches.Rettaliata's rapport with IIT's student community also defined his time. From the Black Knights, a secret group of students he formed to serve as conduits regarding student needs (many of whom now visit the campus twice a year as trustees), to a two-hour question and answer session with protesting students shortly after the Kent State riots, Rettaliata knew to keep his ear toward the students. When told that a great deal of the university's success today is the result of his work back then\u2014with alumni and estate gifts from his time as president providing nearly half of all donations to IIT\u2014he seemed genuinely surprised.When asked how he became such a successful fundraiser, he quips, \"Somebody had to do it.\" And the role wasn't easy, as he describes in the story of how IITRI got its name: \"When MIT did something, MIT got the credit. When[ARF] did something, most people did not know of its relationship with IIT. So I thought we should change the name to IIT Research Institute.\" At the time, ARF was the second largest independent research firm in the United States. As president of IIT, ARF, and the Institute of Gas Technology, Rettaliata held responsibilities to the university and its two major research affiliates. Lester Armour, chair of the Board of Trustees and grandson of Armour Institute founder Philip D. Armour, was less than enthusiastic about the decision. \"Here I was, recommending that we remove the Armour name. I don't think he ever forgave me for that.\"When asked to comment on the university today, Rettaliata quickly flips open one of his last annual reports as president and stops on a page where the new dean of Chicago-Kent College of Law is pictured. He points to a photo of Lew Collens, now IIT's president, and says, \"I think Lew is doing a fine job.\"It's obvious that Rettaliata still has a great deal of pride in both IIT and his legacy, but in his own role in the accomplishments of the university, his modesty prevails. \"There was no silver bullet,\" he says. \"We just worked hard.\"Among former IIT President John Rettaliata's relationships with IIT students during his tenure, no group held more prestige, respect\u2014or more secrecy\u2014than the Black Knights, a small collective of student leaders chosen each year to serve as the president's student advisory board. Unbeknownst to the larger student population, the Black Knights never revealed their identities to the public until Integral was published at the end of the school year.The Black Knights disbanded soon after Rettaliata left IIT in 1973. Some members became CEOs, presidents, and vice presidents of corporations across the country. Others continue to influence the direction of the university today\u2014three current members of IIT's Board of Trustees are Black Knights alumni. One in particular, Martin C. Jischke (PHYS '63), took Rettaliata's example about as far as one can. He became a professor of aerospace engineering, head of his department, dean, and president of three major universities.After graduating from IIT, Jischke attended MIT, receiving an M.S. and Ph.D. in aeronautics, and taught for nearly two decades at the University of Oklahoma. After being interim president at OU, chancellor at University of Missouri-Rolla, and president at Iowa State University, Jischke became president of Purdue University in 2000. In February, President George Bush named Jischke to a seat on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Rettaliata's influence has stayed with Jischke. \"I was dazzled by his fundraising. One of the most memorable meetings was shortly after he had returned from a fundraising trip on the West Coast,\" he recalls. He says Rettaliata's efforts to ensure a balanced budget and strong physical plant have greatly influenced his work at Purdue and other schools. A student group called Iron Key has served the Purdue community for many decades in much the same way as the Black Knights provided IIT students a direct line to the president."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2007/recipe-universe", "content": "IIT physicists join the international race to find the ingredients of our existence.How did matter survive the winner-take-all confrontation with antimatter? Physicists at IIT are exploring this question, and the results may open a new chapter in physics.By now, the notion of antimatter has become so popularly enshrined, it could as easily show up in a children's game as in a physics lecture. \"I'm matter, you're antimatter,\" one playmate might declare, and we all know the catastrophic results should the pair tempt fate and touch each other.Theory suggests that nature produced exactly equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the first turbulent microseconds of creation. Following the inevitable annihilations just after the, there should have been nothing left\u2014no matter, no antimatter.But here we are.The quest for a solution to the puzzle has lured IIT high energy physicists to study a perplexing yet foundational issue known as CP violation. In addition to refining our knowledge of particle behavior, such research may help to explain nature's preference for matter\u2014a subtle favoritism essential for the universe we inhabit.The IITbenefits not only from an outstanding faculty, but from the school's proximity to, one of the most powerful instruments for investigating nature on the tiniest scale, located in Batavia, Ill.In 1975,, then an eager graduate student, joined the team of Leon Lederman, who directed Fermilab's momentous investigations leading to the discovery of the bottom quark. (In 1988, Lederman won the Nobel prize for earlier work on neutrinos.) More recently, Kaplan and Lederman teamed up with Ray Burnstein and Howard Rubin\u2014all now at IIT\u2014forming a strong quartet to collaborate on other experiments, several bearing critically on the behavior of antimatter.Like many scientific curiosities\u2014black holes, relativity, or the existence of genes\u2014antimatter was hypothesized before it was actually observed. In 1928, the physicist Paul Dirac attempted to reconcile two cornerstones of twentieth century physics: special relativity and quantum theory. His mathematical result implied the existence of an elusive mirror-reality, where weird companions to the familiar particles of matter could be found. These antiparticles were believed to have similar properties (like mass and spin) to their matter mates, but would carry opposite charges and other characteristics.At the time of Dirac's insight, no one had yet seen an antiparticle, but all that changed in 1932. Although accelerators had yet to be invented, physicists were able to study cosmic rays\u2014high-energy particles streaming toward earth from space. These observations led C. D. Anderson to discover the electron's antiparticle (now known as the positron). Other antiparticles also began to emerge. Antimatter\u2014no longer restricted to the realm of theory\u2014became a fact of life.Today, most antimatter is confined to the pages of sci-fi novels or the tunnels of powerful accelerators. To all appearance, our universe seems to have been emptied of the stuff. But it wasn't always so. Antimatter enjoyed a brief, violent reign at the very beginning of time. The civil war of particles and antiparticles liberated in the Big Bang should have left a condition almost unworthy of the term universe\u2014a structureless (and surely, lifeless) ocean of radiation, with everything else falling victim to mutual annihilation.Instead, it seems, something very different took place. For every billion antiparticles, a billion and one particles of matter were produced during the period of so-called baryogenesis. The trifling excess of matter paved the way for a cosmos hospitable to both stars and starfish.Nature's curious irregularity, however, was deeply unsettling to physicists, long convinced that antimatter behavior was indistinguishable from the behavior of normal matter and that nature on the tiniest levels operated in a strictly even-handed manner.Physicists speak of three fundamental symmetries in the particle world. These are known as Charge (C), Parity ( P), and Time (T). Charge symmetry implies that if a particle is changed into its antiparticle (a proton into an antiproton, let's say) its behavior should be identical. P, or parity symmetry, assumes that left and right could be interchanged\u2014the world reflected in a mirror will be indistinguishable from ours. Time symmetry (T) demands that the direction of time be reversible.So C, P, and T, these fundamental aspects of matter, ought to retain their pleasing symmetry. Kaplan asks, \"If you happened to live in an antiworld, how would you know?\" The answer is, you wouldn't. At least, this was the long-cherished assumption.But is the world/anti-world symmetry truly perfect to the last detail? Nature, it turns out, has a mischievous side.Parity symmetry was the first sacred cow to be slain, when in 1956\u201357 C. N. Yang and T. D. Lee proposed (and Chien-Shiung Wu experimentally proved) it was occasionally violated. The combination of Charge and Parity (or CP), however, was still assumed to be a fundamental, inviolable symmetry in nature.Today, we know CP symmetry is also sometimes broken. The news came in 1964, with the experiments of James Cronin and Val Fitch, who were able to demonstrate slight CP asymmetry in a particular class of particles known as kaons. The verdict caused both consternation and intrigue in the physics world, but the broad implication was clear: the worlds of matter and antimatter are not symmetric.The most exciting consequence of CP violation is that it offers the first solid clue to the puzzling dominance of matter in the cosmos. This tantalizing possibility accounts for the tremendous interest CP asymmetry has generated among scientists working at opposite extremes in terms of scale.In one domain, particle physicists investigate the most minute constituents of matter over infinitesimally short time frames. In another domain, cosmologists preoccupied with the origins of the universe explore the consequences of CP violation, pondering immense expanses of time and space.IIT physicists have undertaken several grand projects, hoping to shed new light on the mysteries ofin the subatomic realm. At Fermilab, the HyperCP experiment brought the IIT physics team together with scientists from nine other institutions. Their study involves hyperons, short-lived particles built out of three subunits known as quarks.\"Today, we know that everything is made of quarks and leptons,\" Kaplan explains. \"And there isn't just one kind of lepton, we've discovered six kinds of leptons and six kinds of quarks.\" These 12 tiny pieces and the four forces of nature that act on them are a blueprint for designing reality.Elegant in its simplicity, the Standard Model has been a triumph for science, consistent with every observation ever made regarding subatomic particles. For all this, however, the Standard Model cannot be a complete description.One of the key shortcomings of the model is that it fails to explain how all the little building blocks\u2014the quarks and leptons\u2014acquire their mass. An elusive particle known as the Higgs Boson (sometimes dubbed \"The God Particle\") is believed to fill this gap.The trouble is, the Higgs is so elusive that no one has seen one yet. It is now one of the most coveted prizes in any area of physics, and new experiments at both CERN's LHC and Fermilab's Tevatron Collider appear within striking distance of the momentous discovery. If the Higgs is there, we should know fairly soon. The discovery could provide the final jewel in the crown of the Standard Model, helping to answer many particle/antiparticle quandaries, including the mysteries of CP violation.In Fermilab's HyperCP experiment, the IIT team helped design and build one of the highest-rate spectrometers in the world, capable of detecting 100,000 particle events per second. The device allowed for the collection of a staggering amount of data\u2014120 terabytes worth (or roughly 25 times the information on all the websites on the entire Internet).One intriguing though yet-mysterious result of HyperCP involved a rare decay sequence of the so-called Sigma-plus (\u2211+) hyperon. An intermediary particle may have been involved in this peculiar occurrence, which was observed on just three fleeting occasions. If the sequence was more than a statistical fluke, there is a chance the HyperCP group picked up the scent of the reclusive Higgs. Unfortunately, false sightings abound in this tricky arena. Physicists contend it's just too soon to know.And so the search for the origins of matter domination continue. While substantial matter/antimatter asymmetry so far remains absent in the quark sector, perhaps it will appear among lighter particles\u2014the leptons, specifically, in the enigmatic interactions of neutrinos.One of the most intriguing topics in high-energy physics these days, neutrinos were once thought to be lackluster particles of zero mass. They didn't seem to do a whole lot or to interact much with their lively particle neighbors. But recent insights have dragged this tiny entity into the limelight.The sun produces neutrinos in fantastic abundance\u2014some 100 billion or so pass effortlessly through your hand each second as you read this magazine. We now know there are actually three types, or flavors, of neutrino: the electron neutrino, tau neutrino, and muon neutrino. Further, these flavors have an odd tendency to change form\u2014one into the other\u2014in a process dubbed oscillation.Today, two ambitious neutrino projects are luring IIT physicists to Europe and Asia. Kaplan and Rubin are collaborating on a project in eastern France known as Double Chooz, while Chris White\u2014an IIT neutrino authority and veteran of the HyperCP team\u2014is investigating neutrinos at a Chinese facility known as Daya Bay. Rather than using accelerators to generate the particles to be studied, both Double Chooz and Daya Bay will examine oscillation properties among antineutrinos streaming from the cores of nuclear reactors.The three neutrino flavors exist together, in a mixture of states, as White explains: \"One would imagine that if you have an electron-type neutrino that it would have a well-defined mass. It turns out that's not the case. Instead of this subatomic particle being one thing, it's really three things at the same time. It's just one of those wonderfully funny properties of quantum mechanics that allows this to actually be true.\"Both Double Chooz and Daya Bay hope to measure the degree of neutrino oscillation between the electron- and tau-type neutrinos with high precision\u2014a first step before evaluations of CP asymmetry can be carried out.Prospects of fresh insight into the neutrino's peculiar properties as well as early intimations of physics beyond the Standard Model have energized the physics community. IIT scientists are on the leading edge of this research, and the race is now on between Double Chooz's rapid start-up capability and economic efficiency, and Daya Bay's superior thermal output (which produces more neutrinos to study).Rubin speaks enthusiastically of the French project, pointing out that Double Chooz expects to provide a first measurement by 2009. Daya Bay promises to nail down the value with still greater precision, hopefully close enough to determine if a CP violating component can exist.Daya Bay also will be something of a political milestone\u2014the largest basic science collaboration between the United States and China in history. The project's principal U.S. investigator, Kam-Biu Luk, savors Daya Bay's potential: \"This is very exciting and important, and I would love to be part of the team that finds out why we are here,\" he recently told Symmetry Magazine. Concerning the elusive riddle of antimatter's disappearing act, Luk declares, \"It's a good thing, because I don't have to worry about shaking hands with a friend and being annihilated,\" adding, \"It's the reason that everyone and everything exists.\"Studies of CP violation continue to occupy inquisitive minds and powerful machines. Soon, the Large Hadron Collider comes online, and further down the road a still more awesome device, the. IIT researchers are already assisting in the planning stages of this 35 kilometer goliath, as new research inches ever closer to a final account of the matter/antimatter enigma.The coming decade in physics is shaping up to be one of tremendous achievement. A few of the field's most intricate puzzle pieces may soon be moved into place. With an eye toward the future of experimentation, Kaplan considers the road ahead: \"Opinions and hunches are fine, but experiments are the only way to be sure. Nature may have new surprises in store.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2005/crowded-sky", "content": "If it's been a while since your last physics class, it helps to think of wireless messages as airborne planes, crisscrossing along narrowly delineated courses. The first step of air traffic control is to know where the planes are every minute at every elevation of every longitude and latitude. The second step is to make sure that no two of them occupy the same air space at the exact same moment, for obvious reasons.It's the same for wireless transmissions, radio waves traveling in prescribed channels. And like a parade of airborne planes, they don't occupy the complete channel, but travel in packets of information\u2014messages that are received as complete but are really chunked to reduce the risk that whole messages will be lost. This chunking creates gaps, like the spaces between planes, and these gaps allow for other transmissions to be sent through the same general space.So how serious is it when radio waves enter the same channels at the same time\u2014in other words, when interference happens? If you're working on a computer, you may experience a slowdown; on a cell phone, you may find your reception cutting out or get disconnected. Irritating, but not earth-shaking. But it's imaginable that in the not-too-distant future\u2014when the world is even more dependent upon wireless transmissions\u2014there could be total network outages. In industry think tanks, this is referred to as the 'tragedy of the commons'\u2014spectrum overload. Catastrophic failure.The National Science Foundation (NSF) is providing four years of funding to help WIL researchers learn how to keep this from happening\u2014on both small and grand scales.\"The name of the game is how not to interfere. This has become the fundamental issue.\"\u00a0\u2014Dennis RobersonWIL Principal Investigator Dennis Roberson, who was formerly the chief technology officer at Motorola, says that the current wireless environment is not only crowded, it's extremely complicated because the transmissions work on various combinations of time, space, and power. Roberson likens this mix to signal soup and says that the problems begin back at the design stage. Engineers figure out how to build a product by solving a specific problem, and once the product works, the engineer's job is finished. In most cases, Roberson points out, the designers don't have access to extensive information about the larger environment in which the product will be launched, information that if shared would help them design products that would perform even better in that larger environment and, importantly, would not impact other devices as significantly as they do today.\"The name of the game,\" says Roberson about the environment of wireless communication, \"is how not to interfere. This has become the fundamental issue.\" Joining him on the project are professors Cindy Hood of the Computer Science (CS) department, Francis (Wu-Hon) Leung, Joseph LoCicero, and Don Ucci of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, and more than a dozen students drawn from CS and ECE at both undergraduate and graduate levels. This IIT team is partnering with Stevens Institute of Technology, Motorola Labs, and Shared Spectrum Company.With a common goal of discovering how to prevent wireless interference from impacting network performance, WIL researchers and their partners employ a three-pronged research methodology developing and comparing (1) the analytical models, (2) simulation models, and (3) laboratory-based experimental measurements. Using this approach, models for the interference generated by various devices are being developed and refined.IIT's efforts have been focused on the transmitter side. This involves characterizing the radio wave outputs of a large variety of mostly commonplace devices (microwave ovens, wireless local area networks, cordless phones, various Bluetooth devices, etc.).Stevens Institute of Technology, in New Jersey, works on the receiver side, checking the effects of wireless transmissions on the networks.Motorola Labs, in Chicago, supports experiments using their extensive array of specialized equipment and facilities, such as their shielded rooms where no external interference can penetrate the environment.Shared Spectrum Company, in Virginia, performs a variety of external environmental measurements of real channels using precision spectrum analyzers to scan power usage to see what the actual everyday environment looks like\u2014sort of like a morning traffic-news reporter scanning the highways for congestion."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2006/snapshots-court-lives-iit-student-athletes", "content": "While keeping a love of sports in their hearts, IIT student-athletes are leading multifaceted lives and representing the best of IIT.

It's an appropriately big window-the kind that's made for looking out, thinking, and collecting thoughts.It is three weeks before Anderson officially takes office as the eighth president of IIT. Anyone would expect a new university president to be doing a lot of forecasting at this time-and he is-though the unusual early-morning quiet of a city on the verge of a downpour offers him a welcome silence for reflection.\"I did not think I would do this,\" he says without hesitation. \"It's a good lesson in keeping your options open. You never know what's going to happen.\"Rewind to 1969. The unforeseeable \"this\"-a career in higher education-arrived at a crossroads in Anderson's life. Like many master's degree candidates, he found himself choosing between entering the workforce and pursuing his doctorate. On top of this, he was about to spend six weeks at ROTC summer camp in Kansas, a necessity brought on by the Vietnam War. He had not anticipated a tough decision, because there had been only one option. \"I never thought about an academic position. Almost all my relatives worked at, and I envisioned a career in industry,\" he says.\"The university is on a very positive slope both in terms of its resources as well as its attitude-positive attitude is the most significant. It's important as an incoming president to be at a university that is strong but that also has a lot of growth potential.\"His thesis advisor, the most influential figure in his life outside of his family, made the case for academe, citing Anderson's potential as a researcher. \"He told me I could do it,\" says Anderson, whose towering stature belies his soft-spoken demeanor. \"I began to find success in higher education, and I really enjoyed working with students.\"\"It was a good decision. I have never looked back.\"Anderson grew up in Wilmington, Del. His parents were the children of Swedish and German immigrants who first settled in Cleveland, Ohio, after moving to the United States.\"Neither of my parents went to school past the eighth grade, so they were very proud that my sister and I both went to college,\" he says.He received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the. It was there that he met his wife, Pat, a fellow student in math and physics classes. \"In those days it was rare for a woman to be in those classes. She was smart--and better at math than I was, and I thought I was pretty good,\" he says, smiling proudly. \"I really fell for her and worked hard to get that first date.\" Pat worked in computing for DuPont and several universities in the days when knowledge of 'assembler language' was critical. They married in 1968, and have one son and one daughter, both in their 30s, and two grandchildren.Anderson earned his master's and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the, where he pioneered the development and use of micro-porous membranes to study biological transport phenomena. He began his academic career as an assistant professor of chemical engineering and of applied mathematics at Cornell University.He has experienced higher education from nearly every vantage point: student, assistant professor, associate professor, professor, center director, department chair, dean (the latter four at Carnegie Mellon University), and provost (at Case Western Reserve). Anderson has held visiting professorships at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Melbourne (Australia), and the Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (The Netherlands), and guest lectureships throughout the country. He is the author of more than 100 journal articles and book chapters.John Quinn, Anderson's thesis advisor at the University of Illinois and now professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, praises Anderson for holding top administrative positions at Carnegie Mellon \"while maintaining a prominent research program as well as building an outstanding faculty,\" he says. \"He is a natural leader, and he has always had the respect of his colleagues because of his impeccable academic credentials-a quality not always found in academic administrators. John is always up to the challenge, and he is ambitious in the best sense of the word.\"\"At Case Western Reserve and Carnegie Mellon, John earned his reputation as a leader with sharp ideas and an unfailing commitment to education,\" says IIT Board of Trustees Chair John Rowe, who headed the Presidential Search Committee. \"His intelligence, academic credentials, and vision resonated with the search committee, and are the ideal qualities that IIT needs in a new president.\"\"I believe I have an opportunity to make a real impact at IIT,\" says Anderson, a self-described \"glass-half-full\" type of person. \"The university is on a very positive slope both in terms of its resources as well as its attitude-positive attitude is the most significant. It's important as an incoming president to be at a university that is strong but that also has a lot of growth potential.\"While he is pragmatic about the process of unleashing this potential, he is precise and thorough in articulating the four key areas of greatest opportunity at IIT.\"Engineering and the sciences are important. There is tremendous competition with other universities, so our investment has to be made in certain areas where IIT has or could have a comparative advantage,\" he says. \"At the same time, we have to advance other disciplines. We will do this by increasing the size of the pie, not by slicing it into smaller pieces.\"Increasing the undergraduate student body is also a priority. At, undergraduate enrollment soared by 25 percent during his tenure, while the quality of admitted students remained high.\"With John, it's a complete investment in the students,\" says Paul McKenzie, vice president and general manager of biologics manufacturing atand a former Ph.D. student of Anderson at Carnegie Mellon. \"He was invested in more than our lab and class work. He cared about us personally. John wanted us to be successful wherever we went with our careers.\"\"It's the students who have kept me working at universities,\" he says, noting his mentorship of Ph.D. and master's students as his biggest professional achievements outside of his research and election to the National Academy of Engineering and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \"I met with about 15 students right after I accepted the presidency, and they were fantastic. There is a lot we can do to improve student life, the programs we offer students, class size, facilities, and athletics.\"Although he says increasing IIT's national visibility is a decade-long undertaking, it is an opportunity with implications for the entire IIT community. \"This is something I will work both personally and with faculty to improve,\" he says. Anderson believes IIT has the potential to experience a successful growth pattern as did both Carnegie Mellon and Washington University-two universities that, once similar to IIT, have grown in the past 25 years from being largely local to internationally known entities.\"Students have told me national visibility is one of the most important things for them. We have many faculty members with national visibility. We want all people associated with IIT-faculty, staff, students, and alumni-to go out and say, \"I'm from IIT,\" and for others around the country to know our name.\"In his efforts to garner national recognition for IIT, Anderson says it will be equally important for the university to further its relationship with the Chicago community. An increased diversity of the student body, including more local students, offers growth potential stemming from these ties. \"IIT has this on its radar screen. It's important that we attract talented students who may be disadvantaged financially or otherwise.\"It is an issue that is close to Anderson. He is credited with improving diversity of both women and minorities at, while also sustaining the college's ranking among the Top 10 engineering schools in the country.\"I have seen my wife maneuver in a male-dominated field, and my parents were always very inclusive in terms of race and ethnic background. Everyone was a friend to them,\" he says. \"They shaped my very strong, positive views about inclusiveness and diversity.\"\"John is the ultimate networker,\" says McKenzie. \"He constantly surrounds himself with a variety of people of all nationalities and genders. It's what makes him tick, and he likes learning new things from other people.\"In seeking new accomplishments for IIT, Anderson plans to spend his first four months in office preparing for the long term while working to maintain IIT's momentum-learning about the unique culture of IIT, becoming acquainted with the Chicago community and leaders, visiting every building and campus, assessing the quality of existing academic programs, and fundraising.\"I'm a people-oriented person,\" he says. \"I like to meet alumni and donors.\" While at Carnegie Mellon, Anderson increased the number of endowed chairs in engineering from five to 29.Of course, settling into a new city also tops his agenda.\"Pat and I both come from humble backgrounds, so everything we do is a bit of a surprise for us,\" he says. \"Chicago is a vibrant city. We are walkers, so walking will be a great way for us to explore the city.

Nanotechnology brings with it a host of ethical and societal implications, making the subject one of today's most controversial interdisciplinary topics.M. Ellen Mitchell, director of IIT's Institute of Psychology, says attention to the new technology's scientific promise hasn't been accompanied by substantive discussion about personal, social, economic, and legal impacts. Individual issues, she says, merge into societal issues; health issues mingle with consumer concerns, and these areas become inextricably intertwined.\"While we revel in every new power we gain 'over nature', technologies in fact give some people power over other people, with 'nature' as an instrument.\" \u2014Nigel M. de S. CameronThe discussions surrounding nano are similar to ones that stemmed from the, the first large-scale scientific initiative to address ethical, legal, and social implications arising from the potential manipulation of genes. But beyond the ethical considerations are very real physiological ones. Certain substances that are safe in larger quantities assume toxic characteristics at the nano level. There is concern that, because they are so small, nanoparticles can move through the body at will, evading barriers that stop larger particles. Comparisons are being made with asbestos, at one time considered a 'miracle mineral' until it was discovered that asbestos posed a health risk.Taking a cue from the past\u2014including the doomed efforts to bring genetically modified food into Europe, which raised public anxiety about safety issues and the \"futuristic flavor of technology\"\u2014experts have realized the importance of engaging professionals and the public much earlier in the process.Catalyzing discussions about the implications of nanotechnology is the work of Nigel M. de S. Cameron, associate dean and research professor of bioethics at Chicago-Kent College of Law. Cameron is director of Chicago-Kent's Center on Nanotechnology and Society (Nano & Society), created in 2005 with a $500,000 Congressional earmark. It speaks to the importance of this burgeoning, but still largely untested, field.\"The ethical implications are huge,\" Cameron says. \"What does it mean for us, for people, for those who value our common humanity, who want medicine to cure disease and restore function, though not at the cost of commodifying our bodies and brains? What does this mean for those who are aware of the final technological paradox, that the more power we attain to determine ourselves and our children, the more we become creatures of our own design?\"\"And, of course, while we revel in every new power we gain over nature, technologies in fact give some people power over other people, with \"nature\" as an instrument.\"Nano & Society was created as a subset of the(IBHF), a project initiated by Cameron and Chicago-Kent Distinguished Professor of Law Lori Andrews in 2004 to assess the societal and scientific benefits and risks of new developments in biotechnology.In its efforts to advance discussion, Nano & Society promotes two key initiatives and national events, such as the recent Washington, D.C., conference \"NanoWorld: Toward a Policy for the Human Future.\" One initiative is the Chicago Nano Forum, a formal event that is webcast and open to the public. The other is the Nano Colloquium, a more informal biannual IIT roundtable.The thread running through both initiatives is ethics, which makes the IIT approach unique. There are fewer than 100 American universities paying dedicated attention to nanotechnology and none of the others, according to Cameron, is focused on ethics. Ahead of the National Science Foundation's () own key project, \"IIT created the first university-based center on nano and society,\" he says. \"We are on the forefront of the ethics debates.\"Professor Vivian Weil focuses on nothingethics.\"As of yet, we know very little about toxic properties of nanotechnology products,\" she says. \"Sunscreens, for instance it's the nano compounds that block the sun. But what do these nano compounds do to us? They have not been well tested as far as we know. Are sunscreen nano compounds absorbed by the skin? What are the short- and long-term effects? What effect do discarded bottles and tubes have on disposal sites? Government reports are unlikely, Weil says, since sunscreens are classified as cosmetics and therefore don't fall under the(FDA) jurisdiction. Another example of an ethical issue is the impact on the workforce. Radically new technologies are disruptive. New manufacturing processes mean that new workers with new skills enter the workforce and formerly valuable workers are no longer needed. Weil says it is essential to look ahead in order to prevent, mitigate, or compensate for harms to current workers, and that discussions should consider which workers get the benefits and which workers bear the burdens of disruptive changes so that benefits and burdens are not unfairly distributed."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2011/score-another-team-tsao", "content": "The basketball hoop affixed to the Irvine, Calif. garage of Victor Tsao (M.S. CS '80) and his wife, Janie, was just one of many in an area dominated by Los Angeles Lakers fans. But this one was emblematic of the slam-dunk its owners scored in 1988 when, using the garage as a makeshift workshop, they created the multimillion-dollar wireless computer network company Linksys.While the couple later sold both their Irvine property and their company, a Spalding in-ground basketball pole is in place in the backyard of their home today, in Newport Coast, Calif., not far from the residence of Kobe Bryant, the Lakers' all-time leading scorer. Tsao says that basketball has been his passion since he was a kid, when he played on his junior high team in Taipei, Taiwan. He has not only derived physical benefits from the sport but also has gleaned some practical applications as well, centered on the concept of the team.\"Basketball is a highly intensive team sport,\" says Tsao from Florence, Italy, consulting through Miven Venture Partners, LLC, which he and Janie co-run. \"I've played with many different kinds of people throughout my life and have admired many of my teammates. From them I've learned more about working together, tolerance, and making adjustments. In business, you plan and execute with the team, but also spend time doing your homework; you have to play the defense and offense with all you've got.\"The Tsaos have comprised their own team of two since first meeting as students at Taiwan's Tamkang University, and married after they came to the United States. In 1977, the couple moved to Chicago, where they attended graduate school, then settled in California. Over the next decade, they gained both academic knowledge and corporate experience, holding a variety of positions in companies such as TRW, Inc., where Janie served as a systems manager, and Taco Bell Corp., where Tsao was director of MIS strategic systems development. All the while, they discussed their vision for a line of computer peripherals based around the concept of connectivity, and began development during their free time.\"After two years, we had our product line ready and had enough customers to pay our bills,\" says Tsao, noting that it was a family affair, with sons Michael, now 27, and Steven, now 25, helping to package the products.In less than 15 years, Linksys became the global market leader in wireless and broadband hardware for small-to-medium businesses and home environments. The company secured shelf space at major retailers and earned numerous industry awards. In 2001, it was named to the Inc. 500 Hall of Fame, recognized, in part, as one of 22 companies on the list with sales exceeding $100 million.The Tsaos wanted Linksys to expand in the global marketplace and, in 2003, sold the company to Cisco in a stock arrangement valued at $500 million. They were hired by Cisco as part of the executive team heading the new Linksys division and remained with the company until 2007 before shifting their focus to Miven, which was founded in 2005.\"My role at this point in my life is to share my experiences, even though I'm still always learning new things myself, and to be of value to others,\" says Tsao.A multistage venture and public equity investment firm, Miven Venture Partners provides capital for consumer-related technology startups in the areas of information technology, telecommunications, converged media, entertainment, and wireless. Having previously acquired a vast network of contacts throughout Asia, Tsao focuses his efforts on China, but has also assisted promising talent in California and Israel. Some of their investments have included the wireless provider Celeno and Vivotech, a leading provider of high-performance Wi-Fi chips for high-definition multimedia and Near Field Communication equipment and applications.\"When we look at a startup, the first thing we focus on is the people, how everyone works together as a team,\" says Tsao, who adds that they then evaluate the idea itself based on whether it is executable and scalable. Important, too, is the startup's potential to distinguish itself in the global marketplace, which circles back to the effort the team puts in. \"If you work hard, you won't be perfect, but you'll make fewer mistakes,\" says Tsao. \"What that means for the business world is that you'll make fewer mistakes than your competitors.\"Tsao knows that mistakes are also possible without greater cultural awareness. Through the Tsao Family Foundation, the Tsaos and their son Michael are working with the nonprofit Center for Asian American Media (CAAM) to produce a series of documentaries promoting understanding and communication. The series, shot in China by filmmaker Patrick Shen, will provide examples of typical Chinese behavior while offering insight into religious beliefs, historical references, and customs.\"There's no question that the U.S., and possibly the rest of the world, is focused on the rapidly emerging China,\" says Donald Young, CAAM's director of programs, who is overseeing the series. \"The films the Tsaos are interested in producing are explicitly intended to provide a window of understanding into China and its people for Western audiences.\"Young notes that his crew is aiming to complete production of the first film in the series, tentatively titled The Art of Work, by the end of 2012, in time to premiere at a major international documentary film festival.Although living in America for the past 34 years has blurred his own Chinese-American boundaries, Tsao believes his dual identity brings a unique advantage to the filming process. He remembers an instance when he exhibited decidedly non-American business protocol.When the Cisco-Linksys integration team asked Tsao for his vendor agreements, he momentarily choked. \"I don't have even one!\" he says he told the group, adding that for many years, he sealed every business transaction with not much more than a handshake.\"Within one month I obtained agreements from all 12 vendors across Taiwan and China, and since that time, have made sure that I have documents on every matter,\" he says, laughing, wanting to be a good team player, American-style.Asian and American Leadership Differences:Center for Asian American Media:The Leap Celebrities: Victor Tsa"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2011/living-dream", "content": "Her heart pounding, cosmetics chemist and ultramarathoner Emma Caldridge strides up a steep Columbian mountainside.

The twist? She analyzes the implications of this software, and the mimicked writing it produces, from the perspective of an IP lawyer.\"One of the interesting questions is, who owns the copyright?\" asks Piatt, also the executive director of Chicago-Kent's IP law program. \"Is it the computer? Is it the person who programmed the AI? Is it the people whose heads were mined to create the knowledge base? Or is it [the author] whose style they're stealing? Those are just the obvious questions, but there are a lot more you could explore.\" Piatt's case study is a perfect illustration of the often confusing and contradictory applications of IP law.In part, these are the kinds of issues that IP law is intended to define\u2014ownership rights inherent in (or exclusive to) creative and innovative works. Broadly defined as copyrights (artistic material and multimedia), trademarks (brand identities), industrial designs (styles of industrial objects), patents (inventions), and trade secrets (proprietary information of a business or process), IP is exactly what the term implies\u2014property. As with any other asset, it can be bought, sold, transferred, and licensed; often it is an extremely lucrative asset for a corporation.\"Global concerns are more and more predominating, so you need to think not just of United States patent law, but also that of Japan and England.\"\u00a0\u2014Harold Krent, dean, Chicago-Kent College of LawPiatt goes on to explain how her department has restructured the entire IP law curriculum in recent years so it will better represent what students will experience as actual practitioners: \"What we're doing is trying to encourage students to take classes that are not perceived as IP classes, but [those] that we think will make them better practitioners if they can apply what they know in a broader context.\"The formula she outlines is unique: adding courses to the core curriculum that are not typically considered IP-related (Evidence, Administrative Law, Remedies, and Anti-Trust), and creating the \"capstone experience\"\u2014a requirement of all third-year certificate students\u2014designed to make students think more broadly about IP issues.In Chicago-Kent's capstone experience, students must participate in one of three programs: a paid externship with a qualified law firm or corporation; a clinical experience known as the, in which students work with corporate or faculty entrepreneurs to resolve patent issues related to their inventions; or the Strategies in Intellectual Property course, in which students act as practicing attorneys, tackling issues that integrate the various branches of IP law. \"It's not all just pure litigation,\" according to Chicago-Kent's IP law program Associate Director Tim Holbrook, \"it can also have licensing and negotiation aspects to it.\"\"Patenting an isolated gene allows you to control anyone who wants to do research on that gene\u2026That is an act of infringement.\" \u2014Tim Holbrook, Associate Director, Chicago-Kent IP Law ProgramThe approach seems to be working. Although Chicago-Kent's IP law program has been around for two full decades (an eternity in the IP field) and was one of the first of its kind in the country, it recently received one of its biggest honors to date:tabbed it as one of the Top 10 programs of its kind in the country. Holbrook shrugs off the honor. \"It's one of those things we don't want to put too much weight into, because we're always afraid of overemphasizing the rankings.\"Harold Krent, dean of Chicago-Kent, singles out another unique focus of the school's curriculum: International IP Law, the first master's program of its kind in the country. \"Global concerns are more and more predominating, so you need to think not just of United States patent law, but also that of Japan and England. We try to introduce more international considerations than other schools throughout our curriculum.\"Academia is taking notice of this worldly approach. \"In the last 15 years, the internationalization of Chicago-Kent's curriculum has proceeded at a breathtaking pace,\" says Brian Havel, director of DePaul's International and Comparative Law Program. \"IP, in particular, has become an internationally oriented subject thanks to the globalization of commerce and technology. The Chicago-Kent IP program has adapted itself very well, in both its curriculum and its scholarly publications, to the implications of globalization.\"It's important to note that the globalization of IP is more than just a problem for academics to grapple with; it has also created a new set of obstacles for domestic corporations of all shapes and sizes. For instance, the decision of whether to file for patents in foreign countries has become absolutely critical to the healthy development of many businesses.\"The half-life of technology in electronics is about a year. So by the time a patent issues, there would have been six cycles that have basically doubled the capability of electronics. It's pretty crazy.\" \u2014Office of Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property Director Robert AndersonIP attorney and alumna Adrienne Naumann (LAW '84) explains that filing patent applications in multiple countries can be financially prohibitive, even for large corporations. Additionally, \"If you file a patent in this country, it can still be kept confidential if you forfeit your rights to file overseas,\" she says\u2014but this confidentially goes out the window once you file outside of the United States. \"Then the client has to make a decision whether they want to invest in filing overseas and having their confidential information published,or whether they just want to restrict their territory to the United States and have it remain confidential.\" In other words a mistake or oversight in the patent application process has the potential not only to shut the doors on foreign markets, but also to expose the vitals of your patents to competitors all over the world.Of course, globalization isn't the only force driving the explosive growth of intellectual property in today's marketplace. Innovation and advances in technology often dictate how intellectual property is defined\u2014and redefined. \"The pace of technological change has increased so much, one needs to continually refresh one's assumptions about how copyright or patents should work,\" Krent explains. \"There was no real way to anticipate the pressures on the copyright system with the advent of file sharing on the Internet.\"While peer-to-peer file sharing may be the most visible IP issue these days, it is by no means the most controversial; many issues integral to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are bitterly divided. Perhaps no topic better illustrates the complexities and ethical ambiguities of these issues than those surrounding the patentability of human genes.\"Many recent articles have been highly critical of gene patents,\" says Chicago-Kent alumnus Mike Harlin (LAW. '96), a practicing IP lawyer for,, and Malloy, \"saying they were holding back diagnoses and cures for disease. Others believe that granting patents on isolated genes stimulates investment in research on those genes and in drugs to treat genetic disorders.\"Holbrook explains the legal restrictions behind the controversy: \"Generally speaking you can't get a patent on something that already exists\u2014if it's already a product of nature, there's no patent eligibility.\" Although highly controversial, he says that the key to the legal patentability of the human gene \"is that you can get a patent on something that has been purified and isolated, even if it exists in nature.\"What they're doing is patenting the sequence of the good DNA, the functional aspect of the gene. So they isolate that genetic sequence, and the idea is that what you're claiming is a very complex chemical compound.\"Patenting an isolated gene isn't necessarily profitable\u2014not in itself, anyway. However, \"what it allows you to do is to control anyone who wants to do research on that gene, because in the process, you will almost necessarily have to isolate it at some point,\" Holbrook says. \"That is an act of infringement.\"The implications of infringement are widespread, particularly in areas crucial to medical research. \"This is the controversial aspect of it,\" he says. \"Many think that patenting genes is too far upstream, that you're blocking the potential for people to do real discoveries on the things that count.\"To date thehas skirted the subject, but according to Holbrook, \"there is hope\u2014and obviously I'm revealing my normative bias here\u2014that the court will address this type of issue.\" However the current shape of the marketplace may prevent any such litigation from ever reaching the higher courts. Essentially if a small\u2014and likely risk-averse\u2014company is researching a disease that it discovers involves a patented gene sequence, it will likely elect to stop research rather than face costly infringement litigation. Conversely, a large, deep-pocketed corporation may refuse to challenge another company's gene patent in the courts, on the premise that any ruling reversing the overall legality of gene patentability would render its own patents worthless.The bottom line is that as long as companies refuse to litigate over the validity of gene patenting, it will remain legal\u2014which according to Holbrook, is the unequivocal position of the.In response to controversial issues such as gene patenting, among others, IIT formed two organizations\u2014the Institute for Science, Law, and Technology and the Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future\u2014to promote discussion and disseminate knowledge on these topics. Both organizations recruit leading scientists, philosophers, and scholars across a broad range of disciplines to analyze the legal and ethical ramifications of the rapidly changing landscape of science and technology.Gene patenting is just one example of intellectual property's central role in the development of new technologies. IP also plays a crucial role in entrepreneurship, which is a cornerstone of IIT's educational philosophy. Much of IIT's curriculum\u2014engineering, life sciences, business, and law\u2014has been integrated under this multidisciplinary umbrella.Nowhere is this lesson more evident than with IIT's ongoing University Technology Park At IIT (UTP)\u2014a project designed to bridge the gap between inventors and entrepreneurs (both private and academic) and the resources needed to turn their inventions into self-sufficient businesses.UTP's most basic function is to provide customized real estate for researchers and start-up companies, particularly those in the technology and life science industries. But Daniel Marselle, associate director of Technology/Business Services, stresses that the park's purpose is far broader than just \"a real estate play.\" \"We're trying to build a real environment, an 'ecosystem' here,\" he says, \"for hi-tech companies, wherever they are in their life cycle.\"The Jules F. Knapp Entrepreneurship Center, although further upstream in the business cycle, works hand-in-hand with UTP. The Knapp Center was established in a community service vein to help connect budding entrepreneurs (both on- and off-campus) with essential services to get their businesses off the ground. \"Our job is not to run a business for an entrepreneur,\" says Jacob Elster, Knapp's director of programs and services, \"but to provide entrepreneurs with information they need to make informed choices about how to run their businesses.\" These services include research, legal advice, business plan guidance, strategy and development, and financial modeling and projections, among others.The Office of Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property (TT/IP) also plays a crucial role in IIT's ever-expanding entrepreneurial efforts. TT/IP was developed with a much more narrow focus in mind: to license and commercialize the inventions and processes of IIT faculty inventors, or \"technology commercialization.\" \"We want to be known as an entrepreneurial campus, that some of our faculty are entrepreneurs, that we are friendly to entrepreneurs,\" says Director Robert Anderson. \"I represent the university in making technology available to outside entrepreneurs, or licensing it back to the professor himself.\"Anderson cites a $500,000 royalty payment last year as the biggest his office has ever garnered; but that sum, and the term \"technology commercialization,\" can be misleading\u2014this is a program developed to foster synergy between academic research and entrepreneurship, not a profit center.Anderson says that his office, on average, applies for \"about a dozen\" patents per year, and expects \"more than half\" to issue. On its surface that may not sound like a lot, but when you consider the glacial pace of the patent application process, that's actually quite remarkable. \"It can take five or more years for a patent to issue,\" he says.\"Think about it. The half-life of technology in electronics is about a year. So by the time a patent issues, there would have been six cycles that have basically doubled the capability of electronics. It's pretty crazy.\"Although that serves in part as a cautionary tale about the lumbering cogs of government\u2014and highlights the contrast in efficiency between the public and private sectors\u2014it's also a stark reminder of the breakneck pace at which science and technology are still evolving, and the importance of IP law in managing this evolution. Clearly, IIT's multi-disciplinary, hands-on approach to teaching IP law and fostering entrepreneurship ensures the university will play an important role in shaping this evolution in the years to come.One of the most formidable obstacles confronting entrepreneurs is obtaining a patent for their inventions. As TT/IP Director Robert Anderson notes, the process is arduous: \"Current delays can take more than five years in some technology areas.\"The Patent Office's problems are by no means a new phenomenon. Take this excerpt from the November, 1884 issue of\"We are in receipt of complaints from inventors and manufacturers of machinery because of the delay to which they are subjected in obtaining patent papers from the Patent Office\u2026 The number of such articles [of temporary utility] for which patents are desired is by no means small, and the failure of the Government to grant patents promptly simply has the effect to rob the inventions of the whole of their value.\"At least partially, the United States Patent and Trademark Office's (USPTO) troubles can be attributed to a rise in the number of patent applications filed. According to USPTO figures, applications jumped 8.3 percent in 2006.To address this increase, the office hired 1,218 additional patent examiners in 2006, and plans to add another 1,200 this fiscal year. In the USPTO's official 2006 year-end report, Director Jon Dudas outlines the steps his department has taken to help train\u2014and retain\u2014this huge influx of new employees: new, university-style training for inspectors (previously this had been done on a one-on-one basis); the addition of recruitment bonuses to help lure top-notch scientists and engineers; and the implementation of a \"hoteling\" program, whereby inspectors are provided equipment and Internet access, and allowed to work remotely.Additionally, the USPTO has implemented the Electronic Filing System-Web, an online patent application process that Dudas says has \"dramatically increased the electronic filing of patent applications from 1.5 percent per month to 33 percent per month.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2006/small-world", "content": "From fuel cells to nanotechnology, Professor Dimitri Gidaspow has built a distinguished career through innovative work at the particle level.Professoris an IIT institution. His work as both a researcher and a lifelong teacher has made him one of the most well-remembered and well-loved faculty members at the university. IIT even awarded him its highest honor: the title of \"Distinguished Professor.\" The university only elevates to this rank those professors who have achieved preeminence in their field of expertise and who have amassed a record of service to the university. Of the nearly 600 instructors on campus, there are only eight active distinguished professors.Gidaspow has left his mark on IIT, not only in his exhaustive research but through the students he's mentored. His research and teaching spans some of the most critical areas of chemical engineering, including transport phenomena, fluidization, heat transfer, computational techniques, and thermodynamics. Over his years at IIT, Gidaspow has registered for nine patents and authored more than 170 publications. He has served as the principal advisor to more than 50 Ph.D. students, not to mention the hundreds, even thousands, of undergraduate and graduate students who have made their way through his classroom over the past 40 years. And in 2005, he was awarded the IIT/Sigma Xi Research Award in the senior faculty division (only one award is given annually in three divisions: senior faculty, junior faculty, and graduate student).\"I think we created a new science.\" - Professor Dimitri GidaspowA native of the Ukraine, Gidaspow studied in Germany before coming to the United States in 1949 at the age of 15. He attended Seward Park High School in New York, graduating at the top of his class. He earned a bachelors degree in chemical engineering fromin 1956 and spent two years as a teaching assistant at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.Gidaspow came to IIT in 1958 as a work-study student at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT), which was then affiliated with IIT and allowed its students and employees to complete degrees there. He studied under the famed Ralph Peck, and when the latter went on sabbatical, Gidaspow took over Peck's thermodynamics class. Little did he know then that he would become a part of IIT for nearly half a century. In fact, when Peck offered him the teaching job, he responded, \"Fine. But chances are I won't be in Chicago for long\u2014maybe one year.\"That one year turned into decades. Gidaspow enjoyed teaching, and although he returned to IGT (after passing up unprecedented offers from DuPont and NASA), he continued to teach night classes to students from both institutions. He also joined one of his former students, Bernie Baker, on pioneering fuel cell research supported by a multimillion dollar grant from United Technologies Corporation. For his work on fuel cells, Gidaspow received two patents and was recognized by NASA with an award from the Marshall Space Flight Center. But in the spirit of a great teacher, Gidaspow says that \"the best opportunity at IGT was advising good Ph.D. students and cooperating with Bernie Baker.\"Gidaspow officially returned to IIT's Department of Chemical Engineering in 1977 and has taught here ever since. \"The students have not changed much in 50 years,\" says Gidaspow. \"But computers have revolutionized engineering. A half a century ago, doing a Ph.D. thesis meant doing lab work, a lot of it useless for an engineer. Today, students have to acquire computer skills that are immediately useful on their first job.\"Understanding Gidaspow's research is challenging for the layperson, in part because it is a blend of applied science and fundamental research. It is extraordinarily significant, however, for its potential impact on myriad fields. His work falls under the rubric of computational fluid dynamics, which involves using computer modeling to study the physical behavior of fluids, including calculating their properties, such as density, velocity, temperature, and pressure. His specialization is the mixing of gases and solids, particularly in the fields of energy and coal gasification, though his most fundamental research could ultimately be used in applications as diverse as achieving a better understanding of blood flow or creating safer nuclear reactors.Gidaspow's most famous work is on multiphase flow and fluidization, a processing technique used in the chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical, and power generation industries. To understand Gidaspow's research, it is necessary to understand the practical use of fluidization. A fluidized bed is used to suspend solid particles by passing a stream of air through them, thus setting them in motion. This tumbling action works like a bubbling liquid and produces more effective heat transfer and chemical reactions. The technology is extremely flexible and therefore popular; it evolved from efforts to develop cleaner combustion processes, which had the potential to yield fewer pollution emissions. For example, in the coal industry, fluidized bed combustion results in a decreased number of sulfur emissions.The design of industrial-scale fluidized beds remains challenging, and this is where Gidaspow's work on computational fluid dynamics comes into play. He uses a computer to simulate the behavior of particles in order to relate their behavior to certain process and geometric variables. Gidaspow employed a kinetic theory-based particle image velocity method to illustrate that there are two kinds of turbulence in fluidization: random oscillations of individual particles and turbulence caused by the motion of clusters of particles\u2014a theory that revolutionized the field.Funding for Gidaspow's area of research eventually decreased, an occurrence familiar to scientists who rely in large part on external grant agencies, such as the, whose research dollar allocation priorities may change more rapidly than it takes to satisfactorily finish research. However, thanks in part to Gidaspow's former Ph.D. student Madhava Syamlal (M.S. CHE '81), now a government employee at the Department of Energy (DOE), and U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, Gidaspow's research is experiencing a renaissance. One of the areas most affected by fluidization technology is the coal industry. Gidaspow recently received a grant from the DOE to work on the, a $1 billion government initiative aimed at creating the first zero-emissions fossil fuel plant-the cleanest fossil-fuel-fired power plant in the world.Gidaspow will be experimenting with sequestering coal to make hydrogen. All fuels consist of carbon and hydrogen, and coal has a high content of both. When coal is burned, it emits CO, which adds to global warming (thus its reputation as a dirty fuel). By reacting coal with oxygen, however, COcan be separated out, thus preventing ozone depletion and creating a highly desirable, clean fuel in the form of hydrogen. The process sounds simple, but according to Gidaspow, \"If you gasify coal with oxygen, you're going to get huge bubbles inside. No one is going to build a reactor like that, with oxygen bubbles going out. It's not safe.\"And that's where nanotechnology comes in. Nanosize particles don't have any bubbles at all, which makes them ideal, and they flow in a unique way. Naturally, fluidization presents a whole new series of challenges on the nanolevel. As the size of particles decreases, fluidization becomes more difficult because the nanoparticles seem to stick together, forming large agglomerates. Gidaspow and Armour College of Engineering Dean Hamid Arastoopour have partnered withon a project to improve nanoparticle fluidization. Gidaspow theorizes that nanoparticles collide with the molecules and oscillate, and therefore the undesirable bubbles don't form. He is currently working to come up with a mathematical description of nanoparticles using silica particles.www.chee.iit.eduAccording to Gidaspow, his greatest career milestone came in 1985 at the Heat Transfer Conference, where he received the Donald Q. Kern Award for his energy conversion research relating to fuel cells and air conditioning: \"I presented my then-current research on the hydrodynamics of fluidization and heat transfer. The lecture hall in Denver was packed. The editor ofasked me to publish in their journal, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers asked me to write a book.\"That book,, appeared in 1994. Groundbreaking in the field when it was published, it remains the seminal text on the subject today and is used in classrooms all over the world. \"I think we created a new science,\" says Gidaspow."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2006/new-horizon-south-side", "content": "The corner of 35th and State streets at the southeast tip of IIT's Main Campus is the locus for observing the future of Chicago's Mid-South Side. With a 360-degree view of new construction and further development approved, activity at this intersection is signaling a neighborhood on the brink of a new era.Central to this growth is(UTP), comprised of six pre-existing IIT buildings and three proposed new facilities. IIT's newest contribution to the transformation of the South Side, UTP will provide science and technology companies with economically priced laboratory space, including incubator facilities, which are critical to the growth of many start-up ventures. When the project is complete, UTP will boast 1.5 million square feet of rentable space. Although the research park will provide university-wide opportunities, UTP's benefits will extend well beyond IIT.\"When completed in 10 years, this will be huge,\" says David Baker, vice president of external affairs at IIT and interim executive director of UTP, who, along with Dan Marselle (CHE '78), associate director of technology and business services at UTP, is overseeing the project. \"This is an unparalleled opportunity to make an indelible mark on the growth of this part of the city.\"The largest investment in the area since the 1991 opening of nearby U.S. Cellular Field, UTP is, by design, being built to foster an active mixing of science, commerce, and community. Its promise includes access to jobs and internships at UTP for IIT students and close proximity to company consulting opportunities for IIT faculty. UTP clients will be able to take advantage of a number of IIT resources, including use of laboratory equipment, conference facilities, and library and reference facilities, as well as an affiliation with a research university. The surrounding neighborhood will experience an influx of investment in the form of 2,500 job opportunities that UTP is estimated to generate over the next 10 years. UTP will join, heretofore the only site for the development of biotechnology companies in the region, in promoting the growth and expansion of the life sciences industry in Chicago.In an ongoing effort to enhance the Mid-South, the City of Chicago moved the Chicago Police Department headquarters to the corner of 35th Street and Michigan Avenue in 2000. At the same time, the city and the Chicago Housing Authority reached the critical decision to dismantle the failed public housing structures just south of Main Campus. Baker says those changes helped to lay the groundwork for UTP.\"If you had asked anybody in 1999 whether we could attract technology start-ups to 35th and State, they would have laughed at you, because in 1999, other than the new police headquarters being under construction, there was no indication of how quickly this neighborhood was going to change. Also in 1999, all the buildings that are part of UTP were owned by[IITRI], and the university had no interest in acquiring them,\" says Baker. The 2002 spin-off of most of IITRI into Alion Science and Technology led to the university gaining control of the future UTP buildings. Now, market demand is working in tandem with reinvestment in the area to drive the development of UTP.\"The incubator at Chicago Technology Park has been filled for years, and companies were being turned away. As companies have outgrown those facilities, it has been very hard for them to create their next space. A lot of them have left the state,\" says Baker, adding that UTP also will provide a potential new home for University of Chicago's companies and research endeavors, further enhancing the relationship between IIT and U of C.\"Universities tend to have a bad reputation for dealing with commerce and business. But by creating UTP, IIT is saying that it means business.\"\u00a0\u2014Said Al-HallajTo meet this need, UTP is being developed in three phases. Phase I includes the creation of a 30,000-square-feet Incubator in the former Engineering Research Building\u2014originally designed by Mies van der Rohe\u2014co-located with the research laboratories of IIT's biomedical and chemical engineering faculties. The first 6,000 square feet of Incubator space, funded by the State of Illinois, includes room for four companies. The facility features wet and dry labs with adjoining, customizable office spaces and is equipped for clients to add portable natural gas, compressed air, and vacuum systems.\"It doesn't stop with the physical needs,\" says Vice Provost and Director of the Institute of Business and Interprofessional Studies, who has been involved with incubator facilities in South Carolina, Illinois, Malaysia, and Singapore. \"Companies that don't go to an incubator will experience a significant investment of time and money to get their business started. There are a whole set of needs that any new business has: business (including accounting, business plan development, financial planning, human resources, taxes, and payroll), legal (including patent filing and other intellectual property support, company formation, contract support, environmental issues, and mergers and acquisition counsel), and technical consulting and support. Incubator resources can provide all sorts of advice to help fledgling companies jump-start their businesses.\"Phase I also includes Technology Business Center 1, previously called the Chemical Research Building, a $50 million, state-of-the-art, build-to-suit facility for companies needing 3,000-15,000 square feet of space. IIT engaged, LLC, a private developer with strong expertise in research park development, as its partner on the project. Wexford acquired the building from the university and used private-sector financing strategies, city and federal incentives, as well as private equity and debt financing to fund the construction. Work on this facility began in January. The building will be ready for tenant occupancy in summer 2006. Also part of this phase, IITRI Center, now home of IIT Research Institute Life Sciences Group, just completed a $20 million expansion.In addition, software and information technology companies are now locating in IIT Tower, where affordable space goes hand-in-hand with the availability of skilled IIT computer science students.Subsequent phases will include renovation of other existing buildings in UTP and expansion to the parking lots on the east side of State Street, once a new parking garage is built.Two clients taking early advantage of UTP are Said Al-Hallaj and J. Robert Selman, professors in IIT's chemical and environmental engineering department. In 2001, Al-Hallaj and Selman formed, LLC to develop and commercialize lithium-ion batteries for portable power and electric vehicle applications. Last year, Al-Hallaj and some of his students launched Sun Phocus Technologies, LLC, a company that is working to develop and commercialize solar powered windows for use in generating electricity for office buildings. All Cell and Sun Phocus moved into a new laboratory space in the Incubator in February and began operating there in March.Al-Hallaj says that his companies' affiliation with UTP is already starting to pay off. \"With All Cell, we approached the City of Chicago about working on a Plug-In version of the hybrid Ford Escape. Our affiliation with IIT gave us a lot of credibility. If I had gone to the city on my own, I don't think I would have received the same response.\"While UTP is largely being marketed to and suited for biomedical engineering and life-sciences companies, another client, a digital data storage start-up called Cleversafe, is growing steadily thanks in part to a talented workforce: IIT students.Chris Gladwin, Cleversafe's founder and CEO, says he moved his company into 3424 South State and began hiring IIT students last winter. It started with one part-time student, then two, and now 15 current or recently graduated IIT computer science and design majors are among his 22 employees.Gladwin says that compared to employees with backgrounds in one area of expertise, students have proven to be more creative and adaptable. \"This is my third major start-up; at the previous two, I hired people who had 20 or 30 years of experience,\" says Gladwin. \"IIT students are better for the work we do: it's technology-driven, but creative. It's better suited for smarter, creative people, and these students have what we're looking for.\"Cleversafe is benefiting from IIT students in other ways. In March, as part of a contest run by the College of Architecture, two architecture students were selected to design Cleversafe's new office in the Tower, to where the company will expand this summer. Another student won the rights to be project manager.\"That sort of thing would not happen if we weren't at IIT,\" Gladwin says. \"I'll have access to brilliant architects, and I have a great story to tell my clients about why my company is interesting. And because we're on a campus at a major research university, we have a lot more credibility.\"At the outset of IIT's 1996 Master Plan, created by Trustee Dirk Lohan as part of the National Commission for IIT, the south end of campus was designated for future commercial development. In 2000, President Lew Collens saw an opportunity for an on-campus technology park to give faculty the chance to be more entrepreneurial and to form more companies of their own.With IIT able to leverage existing buildings on campus, the campaign for UTP began. In October 2005, the City of Chicago, at IIT's request, created a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district on the south end of campus. This designation enabled Wexford to receive $13.4 million in tax increment financing, allowing it to renovate the building and still charge affordable rents to technology companies.The UTP construction timeline now coincides with the creation of IIT's 2010 Plan-the set of university priorities that will capitalize on IIT's strengths in research and academics into the next decade. The university has identified life sciences, energy and sustainability, entrepreneurship, and its continued Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) program as key priorities. Roberson says that UTP will marry well with the initiatives included in the 2010 Plan. As UTP evolves, company employees could propose new IPRO projects and offer the participants appropriate feedback, and students could provide companies with reasonably priced market research, accounting services, and other business assistance 'thereby enriching the students'\u00a0own entrepreneurial experience.\"Since UTP expects to house companies from a variety of areas, it will have a very positive impact across IIT. The opportunity for students to engage with firms right on campus is wonderful, and faculty members have the opportunity to be on advisory boards for companies and to act as part-time consultants,\" says Roberson, who will serve on the board of Cleversafe. \"The companies can get experienced people to help support them, while faculty have the opportunity to delve into the 'real-world challenges' associated with the areas they're interested in, all in the context of an entrepreneurial business environment. It's a terrific win-win-win situation.\"Market demand is working in tandem with reinvestment in the area to drive the development of UTP.If UTP is as successful as other university-affiliated research parks, its benefits could extend well beyond the immediate community. Research parks have had a transformative effect on their local economies: Stanford University's research park, and more recently, Research Triangle Park's collaboration between Duke University, North Carolina State University, and University of North Carolina Chapel Hill are two such examples.\"Ours is a more modest goal focused on trying to create economic growth to complement the residential and commercial activity here now,\" says Baker. He cautions that while attracting occupants to a park of this size always presents a risk, ultimately, IIT's ownership of UTP is a distinguishing factor when compared to other technology parks within the Chicago area, including Illinois Science + Technology Park in Skokie, which opened in 2005.\"Our selling point,\" says Baker, \"is that we are looking for companies that want to be on a university campus, to employ our students, and to use the academic and research resources that we have here. That's a main difference between what's happening here compared to the more industrial focus of the Skokie facility.\"As activity at UTP, and UTP itself, continues to advance, so, too, will the area surrounding the park. A variety of amenities planned for the neighborhood are expected to help attract UTP's clients and prospective residents to the neighborhood. This includes a new federally funded Metra stop at 35th and Federal streets, which Baker anticipates will be completed within five years, and commercial and residential development.A new residential development directly south of the Tower, Park Boulevard, officially broke ground in December 2005. The privately held, 1,300-unit, mixed-use community-which will rise in place of a former public housing site-will include spaces for restaurants and other businesses. At the groundbreaking ceremony, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley had strong praise for the complex, referring to Park Boulevard as a place that will 'rebuild the souls' of the people who will live there.With the development of UTP and its surrounding neighborhood underway, a series of projects more than a decade in the making are just beginning to transform what was once a bustling metropolis for music and commerce in Chicago. As the city, state, and IIT work together to realize this goal, the university's commitment through UTP is shaping up to be a bold investment in the neighborhood that once thrived around IIT.Says Roberson, \"It's synergistic: as UTP becomes more successful, it will contribute to the surrounding environment, which will in turn contribute to UTP's success. It's a virtuous cycle.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2011/turning-traffic-trickle-stream", "content": "Whether you drive or take public transportation, your synthetic composite counterpart is also traveling on Zongzhi Li's desktop computer. With travel and traffic information gathered from census, survey, and field data, Li, an associate professor of transportation engineering at IIT Armour College of Engineering, is formulating the daily comings and goings\u2014an estimated 28.5 million trips\u2014of some 9.7 million people in the Chicago metropolitan area. His work is part of a next-generation transportation planning, traffic operations, and evacuation planning and emergency management project.The development of a large-scale activity-based Transportation Analysis and Simulation System () toolbox was initiated in the early 1990s at Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the vision of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. TRANSIMS originally aimed to assist transportation planners in determining if a possible transportation plan would meet multimodal transportation infrastructure, mobility, safety, energy consumption, and air-quality standards in an area. It quickly became an effective tool for simulating normal and emergency travel conditions as well as helping transportation leaders make the most cost-effective investment decisions.Several years ago, the toolbox project was transferred to the super-computing facility at Argonne National Laboratory. A proof-of-concept Chicago TRANSIMS model was tested by Argonne's Transportation Research and Computing Analysis Center, and funded by the United States Department of Transportation. The Chicago model was fully developed and calibrated by an IIT-led research team, in collaboration with the Chicago Department of Transportation, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the University of Arizona, and Herbert S. Levinson (CE '49), an independent transportation consultant. The Chicago model encompasses the entire road, transit, and pedestrian walking networks in the Chicago area.Covering more than 10,000 square miles\u2014from Rockford on the west, to Milwaukee on the north, and Kankakee and Gary on the south\u2014the project simulates movements of individual travelers over a 24-hour period daily on a second-by-second basis, and according to Li, is the largest and most complex of its kind in the country. As the Chicago TRANSIMS model's principal investigator, Li has made significant contributions.\"Using the Chicago TRANSIMS model, we were able to estimate the traffic volume of every hour of travel at every freeway mainline or arterial road location with at least 95 percent accuracy, and travel time and vehicle speed with more than 85 percent accuracy,\" says Li.Guided by David Baker, IIT vice president of external affairs, and Associate Vice President Jeanne Arens as well as Armour Dean Natacha DePaola, Li has met with congressmen Danny Davis and Dan Lipinski as well as members of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to discuss the significance of the TRANSIMS model for transportation security planning and emergency preparedness. Li recently used the Chicago TRANSIMS model to help Illinois State Toll Highway Authority evaluate and prioritize a $12 billion capital investment program proposed by the Illinois Tollway Board.Levinson, a member of the National Academy of Engineering who is reviewing and editing the IIT team draft reports, says that the strength of the TRANSIMS model is in its ability to provide accurate depictions of traffic flow.\"The IIT team's estimated values provide a good depiction of actual ground counts of traffic volumes in the Chicago area,\" he says. \"Work is also in progress that estimates the effects of closing Lake Shore Drive for an hour each day. This is a complex effort because some trips would not be made while others would change mode and/or time of day.\"Just in time for the winter driving season and hoping to prevent a weather-related traffic debacle like the one that occurred in Chicago on, Li has also developed a TRANSIMS simulation diverting traffic from Lake Shore Drive during a blizzard."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/tags/quality-student-experience", "content": "Ten years ago as a high school senior in Anchorage, Alaska, with good grades and test scores, I was deeply involved in my search to find the \"perfect\" college\u2014one that would educate as well as inspire me.

The following year, she was counting her blessings when her supervisor, a military veteran, told her about a new program to assist veterans, reservists, National Guard members, and their families in Lake and McHenry counties. Matteson, whose military connections include her ex-husband, two brothers, and three nephews who are entering the military this year, is receiving personal counseling and food pantry benefits thanks to a unique peer-to-peer project through the(LCHD) and Illinois Institute of Technology.\"My counselor is available anytime I need to talk,\" says Matteson, who sought assistance for coping with the stress of family traumatized by past combat situations in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"I had an unrelated crisis and needed somebody to talk to, and she was there for me even for that.\"The five-year program, which made its debut in May 2011 with a $3.75 million grant from theAdministration, focuses on transforming mental health services for members of the military and their families using a two-pronged approach: it is non-office-based and is administered primarily by veterans of various military operations, including the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and current conflicts. The program aims to further engage clients in communication, reduce the number of hospitalizations, address issues of homelessness, teach crisis management, and lessen the stigma of mental illness.\"Current research says that our program should be mobile and community-based,\" says Jonathon Larson, IIT assistant professor of psychology and co-principal investigator (along with Ted Testa, LCHD behavioral health services director). \"Many veterans can't get to an office so we have vans to meet them at locations where it's convenient for them.

His retirement didn't signal a farewell to public service, however. Nudelman, 65, currently is at work on two of the highest-profile matters of his career: the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal, and the re-examination of Chicago police torture and coercion cases.The church cases came to Judge Nudelman in 2007; since then, he has served as both an arbitrator and mediator in disputes between abuse victims and the archdioceses and dioceses in Chicago and around the country. As special arbitrator, Nudelman handled a group of cases for the Archdiocese of Chicago that resulted in settlement payments to victims.Nudelman acquired his second set of high-profile cases in April 2009, when he was named special prosecutor for a group of decades-old cases. These cases are being re-evaluated in light of a federal court's finding that former Chicago police commander Jon Burge coerced confessions at two police stations on Chicago's South Side. As special prosecutor, Nudelman evaluates requests for retrial or other relief, and must determine whether a case is likely to fall apart if the defendant's confession is thrown out.Nudelman shares his thoughts on both cases with IIT.Stuart Nudelman: So far as the cases involving the church, as well as the Burge cases, absolutely. In those cases, the aspect of how the outcome will affect the public good, or how it will affect future allegations of torture and coerced confessions by police officers, or allegations of sexual abuse by priests or other people within religious hierarchies\u2014considering that aspect is huge.You do think about what effect your decision will have, if you're a judge or arbitrator, or what your work as mediator is going to do to try to resolve some of those issues. In those instances, you look very often beyond the particular case before you.I was a judge for 21 years, and that helps with my approach. As a judge, you weigh how a decision is going to affect the parties before you, and then sometimes when the case involves public issues, you also have to weigh how the outcome is going to affect the public in general or how it's going to affect the future of that particular dispute if there are other disputes like it.SN: As a special prosecutor, you can't look beyond your particular case. Each case has to be looked at individually. So even while there are allegations of mass abuse of prisoners during interrogations, you still have to look at each individual case and not judge all the cases together. That's paramount to working in any level of the criminal justice system.SN: You look at each case to determine, first, what kind of evidence was used in the prosecution and ultimate conviction of the defendant. If it was primarily or solely based on the confession, and it appears there is evidence that that confession was coerced, and then you also find that there's really no other substantive evidence to get a conviction, and then you add to that the fact that it's a 25-year-old murder case, then sometimes a decision is made that there's no purpose to go any further.On the other end of the scale, you get cases where the confession may have been coerced, but there is such a plethora of other evidence\u2014eyewitnesses, physical evidence. There's still more than sufficient evidence for a finding of guilty, even without the confession. Those are the ones that you pursue as a special prosecutor, though of course a judge ultimately makes the decision about whether to grant a post-conviction hearing or a new trial.In between those two extremes, there are cases where you talk to the other side to find out if maybe it's time for a plea on certain charges. If the person has done 25 years in jail, then perhaps there's a way that the incarceration ends as one of the terms of a plea agreement, and some cases can resolve that way.SN: The cases do ask for money damages, certainly. All the parties I've worked with agree that certainly money is an aspect. Very often you need more than that, though: you need counseling, and you need to find out how to repair relationships between certain parishioners and the church.The other aspect of it, and this is also from both parties' point of view, is looking at 'How do we make sure this doesn't occur again.' That broader goal has to be something you're concerned about, something that's part of your thinking.SN: In both cases, I believe there's been a tremendous change in various dioceses and archdioceses around the country relating to the problem of sexual abuse by members of the Catholic Church, as well as within other religious institutions. They are much more aware of the problem, and they are dealing with it appropriately. They've always taken it seriously, but until now there's always been some necessity or want on their part to keep it within the church; they realize now that this is an issue that the public and the authorities need to be involved in. I think there's been a tremendous change in their attitude toward these cases and in their willingness to be open.In the Burge cases, there's no question there's a difference with what took place 20 and 30 years ago compared with what takes place today in police stations or other places where questioning is done. We're using more recording devices today, we're using video cameras, so that process is more open. And people are not held in custody for 24 or 48 hours without some contact with an attorney. Through the exposing of these cases, there's been a tremendous amount of public good achieved, and I think it's continuing."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2011/pawar-people", "content": "As staffers buzz around the new 47th Ward office, cleaning desks, arranging chairs, and checking the clock, the new alderman glances around the room once more at his just-assembled collections of donated office furniture and neighborhood art.It's been only four months since Ameya Pawar (M.P.A. '07) pulled off a stunning election-night upset of Tom O'Donnell, the rival candidate hand-picked by the ward's retiring 37-year incumbent, Gene Schulter.Pawar, 31, won by promising an approach to governing that would be based on transparency, responsiveness, and community engagement. Tonight, at his first 47th Ward \nopen house, his challenge is to begin to turn those promises into action.The first residents through the door are Helene Ortega and Barbara Rila, both of whom have lived in the 47th Ward for decades. Ortega heads straight for the alderman.\"Congratulations!\" she says. \"I told all my friends to vote for you. Now, what are you going to do for the seniors?\"Soon, Pawar, Ortega, and Rila are looking at ward maps. Ortega is pointing out streets with troublesome potholes, and Pawar both notes the locations and explains that he's placed a freeze on re-paving projects until he's able to coordinate with local utility providers to avoid duplicating the work.Pawar knows that a large part of being an alderman is dealing with people who want things from you\u2014residents, businesses, nonprofits, city council members, and the mayor, among others. He insists that he's prepared for the challenge of putting his approach to work in a real-world context.\"It's easy, as a candidate, to look in and think everything is broken,\" Pawar says. \"Once you're inside, you see it's not so. A lot of aldermen would say my approach is not new, and that greater transparency and responsiveness are things they wanted. But the bureaucracy can be hard to navigate.\"When Pawar returned from a 10-week stint in India as a State Department Scholar in 2009, he decided to run for alderman. He had previously developed a theory for community governance called \"Social Intelligence\" \nalong with some fellow University of Chicago graduate school classmates, and he asked them to help with the campaign. (Pawar has a master's degree in threat and response management from U of C in addition to his IIT master's degree.)Charna Epstein agreed to help with Pawar's campaign. She says the 47th Ward is an ideal community for putting Social Intelligence to work.\"In our ward, we have a lot of people who are really invested in community and in sharing information. That means [Pawar] can actually make an impact,\" says Epstein, who is now Pawar's deputy alderman and chief of staff.One 47th Ward resident promises to be particularly vital to Pawar's success: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Pawar predicts Emanuel will rely on the city council more than his predecessor, Richard M. Daley, did.The open house, however, isn't about the mayor or other power brokers. It's a chance for Pawar to meet residents like Ortega and Rila. He is learning quickly how many different directions an alderman gets pulled.Pawar isn't overwhelmed, though. As various homeowners, businesspeople, parents, and seniors raise their concerns, he listens, takes notes, and asks questions. During the campaign, Pawar introduced an iPhone app that allows residents to relay service requests to the ward office. Pawar's Social Intelligence model is based on real-time feedback and participatory democracy, so the issues these residents raise aren't a nuisance; they're critical data points and opportunities that will allow Pawar to show that he can make a difference.Leaders in the 47th Ward say he's gotten off to a promising start.\"[Pawar] has done a really good job of inviting community involvement and encouraging a collaborative process to solve the issues facing our neighborhood,\" says Melissa Flynn, executive director of the chamber of commerce for Lincoln Square, a 47th Ward neighborhood.Pawar hopes that someday Social Intelligence will transform communities far beyond the 47th Ward. He also understands it's a long, slow process\u2014one that starts at a ward-office open house, talking about potholes and planning a bright future."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2010/always-teacher", "content": "Shelley Brown enjoyed two birthday cakes the year she was a freshman at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on Chicago's Near West Side. One celebrated the day that she was born. The second cake changed the direction of her life.\"I owe my decision to pursue a lifelong career in biomedical research to Hortense Brice,\" says Brown, of the Chicago Public Schools biology teacher who assigned her class to come up with creative ways to portray a human cell in three dimensions. Brown envisioned a birthday cake as the cell, with its organelles drawn in colored icing.\"The idea for the cake may have been simplistic,\" says Brown, who is now a Ph.D. candidate in biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan. \"But the impact Ms. Brice's teaching and that project had on my life was monumental.\"In the 1990s, Brice regarded the still-emerging field of biotechnology with great interest and began educating herself by enrolling in teacher workshops on the subject at institutions ranging from the University of Chicago to Dartmouth College. Credited with bringing the study of biotechnology to CPS, Brice is now extending the field's reach to hundreds of classrooms through her leadership in a professional development program for CPS middle school and high school teachers.Brice, who attended the Leadership Cohort master's program in IIT's Department of(MSED), retired in June 2009 after 42 years as a CPS educator. She is now devoting her time to a new program held in partnership with global medical products and services company. Funded for five years, the program aims to train at least 30 teachers each year to bring biotechnology to the classroom.\"My dad always used to say, 'Any old way won't do.' And if I've shared anything with students over the years, I've told them very nicely, 'You are capable of achieving whatever you want.\"Home base for the teacher development program is Lindblom Math and Science Academy, where Brice taught for the last four years of a career that also included appointments as biology teacher at Harlan Community Academy, biology teacher and science department chair at King College Prep High School, and biology teacher at Whitney Young. Her office is next to the biotechnology classroom and laboratory she established when she first came to Lindblom, still decorated as she left it, with clusters of colorful buckyball models hanging from the ceiling. Her voice is soft but her words convey a strong sense of self and purpose that is grounded in Southern-bred convictions of family, church, and education.Although she was born in the rural South, her mother made sure that books were a staple and typical Christmas gifts for Brice and her two sisters. Weekly trips to the local library and placement on the honor roll were all expected of the siblings, who would not play house but school, with eldest sister Brice as the teacher. When the family moved north, Brice's father learned the pipefitting trade and her mother went to school to become a medical technician. The sisters all graduated from college, with each chipping in to help pay the other's tuition costs. (Brice's late sister Delores \"Dee\" Parmer Woodtor earned a Ph.D. from Northwestern University and her sister Twinet Parmer earned a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa.)For a short time Brice was married, though she raised her son singlehandedly after she and her husband divorced. Money was a little tight, but Brice knew how to make a stew of chicken drumsticks, veggies, noodles, and a dash of Lawry's seasoning go a long way.\"My dad always used to say, 'Any old way won't do,'\" says Brice about her father, who instilled in her this mantra as one of his many Alabama values. \"And if I've shared anything with students over the years, I've told them very nicely, 'You are capable of achieving whatever you want.\"It's all in your philosophy. That's why I always sing my parents' praises as well as those of other older people who had some influence on my life,\" Brice explains. \"Money is important, yes. But you can raise your children and bring them up properly without having a lot of money. It's about parental expectations and modeling, how high you raise the bar, and the importance you place on values, integrity, and character.\"Brice has seen many parents make education a priority. After accompanying Brice on a class field trip to Lincoln Park Zoo, the mother of one Whitney Young student living in the Cabrini-Green public housing development was motivated to work two jobs\u2014one that brought in money for daily living and a second for her daughter's new computer fund. Brice's own resourcefulness and determination netted thousands of dollars for laboratory tools through corporate grants she wrote to bring biotechnology to CPS.Other priorities prevented the biotechnology program from gaining firm ground at both King College Prep and Whitney Young, but things changed when Brice went to Lindblom and met Principal Alan Mather, who encouraged her to write a course description to present to the Chicago School Board. The yearlong course was approved for launch at Lindblom, a selective-enrollment high school.Mather spoke with Baxter representatives about partnership opportunities with the school and invited them to Lindblom's \"Principal for a Day\" program, where they observed the biotechnology course taught by Brice.\"They left saying, 'Now we know how we want to be involved,'\" says Mather. \"It was certainly her passion and competence that inspired those at Baxter to become involved in CPS. There is no other way to describe this partnership as coming from anywhere but from Hortense.\"The Baxter grant provides $2 million to support the Biotechnology Center of Excellence at Lindblom Math and Science Academy, $1 million to support the CPS Renaissance 2010 model schools' initiative, and $2 million to supplement ongoing learning opportunities for students and teachers throughout the city, including programs through MSED, which are benefiting from a gift of $680,000.Norman G. Lederman, MSED professor and chair, says that current science education reform emphasizes the integration of the sciences, orients science in a problem-based learning environment, and engages students through authentic, real-world problems.\"Emphasis on biotechnology is a very effective way to accomplish these goals,\" says Lederman. In recognition of Brice's contributions toward shaping the next generation of Midwest biotechnology and life sciences innovators and leaders, she was given the 2008 iCON Knowledge Builder Award from the, an Illinois organization that promotes biotechnology education, training, and research.Of the many recommendations made in the 2007 report Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, issued by the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, is one that states, \"laying a foundation for a scientifically literate workforce begins with developing outstanding K\u201312 teachers in science and mathematics.\"One influential teacher can make a lasting impression on a student, just as one did for Shelley Brown.Baxter International, Inc.:IIT Department of Mathematics and Science Education:Renaissance 2010 Project:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2012/clean-water-grows-opportunity", "content": "The irony of townspeople, who during the rainy season have no access to potable water remains a vivid memory for Dhara Shah (BME 4th year) and crystallized the value of the work she and the other members of the IIT Chapter ofare doing as part of.In 2008, the mayor of the rural Haitian municipality La Victoire approached EWB\u2013IIT members with a request that they help to design a clean drinking water system for the community of 3,000 people, says Shah, who is the chapter's director of projects and project manager of the water supply and distribution project. On one of the group's assessment trips to Haiti, Shah recalls that La Victoire was without water for three days because mud from the incessant rains had clogged pipes comprising the town's antiquated water system.\"My team and I consumed at least two bottles of water on our three-mile hike that morning while the community members\u2014who can't afford water bottles\u2014drank out of a dirty river where people washed their laundry and bathed; or they walked those same three miles to a spring,\" says Shah. \"Not only this community but thousands of towns and cities like La Victoire, for various reasons, don't get clean drinking water every day. Lack of access to clean water impacts all aspects of the community members' lives.\"Last August, the IIT team went on a site-assessment trip to finalize the design of the first of three planned phases of the water project, which includes capping a spring and designing a chlorination system, a distribution network, a simple suspension bridge, educational components on hand washing, and a fundraising plan to cover initial project costs. Shah says that since the townspeople themselves will need to manage the new system, a Water Committee was established to draw up plans on how the system will be operated and maintained in the years ahead.\"My highest sense of satisfaction from the project occurs when we talk to the Water Committee or a school committee and hear that they are repairing things on their own or have been collecting dues to save up for future repairs\u2014that they own the system,\" explains Shah, noting that the project has helped her to realize the complexity and dynamic nature of working in developing countries as well as the importance and implications of being a socially responsible engineer.\"As an engineer equipped with tools to design systems to partner with these communities, I see it as my responsibility to use these skills to help improve quality of life issues,\" says Shah. \"It's important to me that I'm using the knowledge that I obtain from my IIT education to contribute to sustainable infrastructure development in communities that don't always have the resources themselves.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2010/one-year-after-fall-lehman", "content": "The dark night is now past. Or is it? One year after the global financial-services firm Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008 and set the world atilt,asked, Industry Professor of Finance and director of the Center for Financial Markets at IIT Stuart School of Business, his impressions on the collapse and what can be done to safeguard the country's financial situation today.We are still learning. One lesson was learned immediately and that was, given the market reaction to Lehman, the government couldn't allow another big institution to go under; so a few days later, the Treasury and Fed decided that AIG would get bailed out. There is still a debate about whether Lehman was too big or too interconnected to fail. For example, on the day of its bankruptcy, it had 1.2 million derivatives transactions, with 6,500 trading partners in the United States alone. Most of these were terminated by their trading partners, but there are some 300 Lehman estate people sorting through the remaining contracts.Coming off the 2000 tech crash and 2001 recession, the Fed lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy. This made mortgages cheaper, attracting homebuyers, but also got international investors interested in mortgage-backed securities that paid higher interest rates than T-bills. The mortgage origination business went into overdrive, pushed also by government policy to bring more people into the American home-owning dream. This, combined with a poorly regulated mortgage market, resulted in a decline in credit worthiness standards and fraudulent sales practices, putting lots of people into mortgages that they would never be able to pay. These sub-prime mortgages, many poorly documented, got packaged and thrown into pools, and mortgage-backed securities were issued based on these pools. The credit rating agencies didn't do their job well and gave high ratings to mortgage-related instruments, which they really didn't always understand and that soon dropped in value and had to be downgraded. Too many people felt that a continued rise in housing prices would cover up all sins, mistakes, and fraud. But prices stopped rising, the housing bubble popped, and the world came undone.Nope. I'm not smart enough.Huge. The government is a major player in the economy by what it does on the spending side as well as what it does on the money-supply side. Had the government behaved differently in 1929 and the early 1930s, we might not have had the Great Depression.There are some wonderful things that the government has done historically to encourage home ownership in the United States. There are many countries in which acquiring a home involves getting some land, then each year buying as many bricks as your savings allows and building a piece of a wall, acquiring some more bricks and building more wall next year, and then after maybe five or 10 years, you have a home; mortgages don't exist.In the early years of the United States, when mortgages began, they were often interest-only with a balloon payment at the end, so people would often never gain title to the home they were paying on. With the development of the modern, standardized 30-year mortgage and the creation ofand, which purchased and pooled these standardized mortgages creating and selling securities backed by these mortgage pools, much more money came available for home buyers. Our mortgage market became the envy of the world.One change I would make is to better regulate the mortgage origination business, that Wild West, fee-driven arena in which salesmen talked too many people into mortgages they weren't qualified for, mortgages that were too expensive and impossible to pay off. This created great harm to the borrowers who ultimately went into foreclosure, to the neighborhoods with tons of vacant houses, and to those who invested in these mortgages.Make sure that knowledgeable, thoughtful, and pragmatic people are managing the Federal Reserve System, the Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC. Have some group, whether a committee of agency heads or a single agency like the Fed, charged with the responsibility of watching for the development of systemic risks in the financial system.They shouldn't have gotten out. The stock market is incredibly difficult to predict. There are a few people who appear to be good at it, who seem to do well over the long haul by moving in and moving out, but those people devote most of their time to the market. Most people who get in and out do worse than those who just stay. For most of us mortals, the best strategy is probably consistency. Put your money in a diversified portfolio of stocks, a mutual fund, or an, and stop worrying about it.So much better than they might have been."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2010/photography-journey", "content": "Of the many photographs that are everywhere in Barbara Crane's cozy, white-walled studio in Chicago's West Loop, there is one 8\" x 10\" image hanging apart from the others that, in a way, started it all, sending Crane and her viewers on a more than six decades-long trip that turned artistic photography upside-down, inside-out, and just about any other direction in-between. In the mind's eye, the picture's black, gracefully curving lines set against a stark milky background could be a black-and-white pencil drawing of a young shoot arching toward an unseen sun. Rather, it is an overexposed and overdeveloped gelatin silver print close-up of the backside of Crane's son, Bruce. Shot in 1964, the photograph served as the impetus for her 90-image master's thesis at IIT Institute of Design.A self-described \"experimenter,\" Crane (M.S. PHOT '66) produced the flowing abstract of her child in response to an ID student who criticized one of her other prints. \"I came out of the classroom thinking, 'I'll show him!'\" says the petite Crane, with a laugh and an ever-present spark in her eyes, which have observed thousands upon thousands of images over a lifetime devoted to a singular passion.Images representing Crane's career are being featured in three Chicago exhibits., is on display in the Kemper Room Art Gallery at IIT's Paul V. Galvin Library through Monday, February 1, 2010. A larger exhibit,, is on display at the Chicago Cultural Center through Sunday, January 10, 2010. Being shown as the Stephen Daiter Gallery through Saturday, December 12 is.Crane was assured of her life's calling when she first saw a print being developed and heard her amateur photographer father exclaim \"Abracadabra!\" in the dark room of their home in Winnetka, Ill.\"It was always a miracle,\" she says, thinking back to how the image appeared in the wooden contact-printing frame her father had constructed. \"Now, would I be doing what I do if I hadn't had that early experience in my teens with him? I was an art history major in college and had to learn how to do reproductions of paintings. But my influences are in my early magic in the darkroom.\"A college design teacher introduced Crane to ID founder L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy's textbook, giving Crane her first real taste of ID's abstractionist ideologies.\"The Institute of Design gave license to people to be very explorative. They were encouraged to look outside of the box, to embrace the theories and design elements of the day,\" says Kenneth C. Burkhart, guest curator of the Chicago Cultural Center show. \"People like Barbara came out of that.\"In 1964, Crane showed(1903\u20131991), ID professor and photography department director, a portfolio of professional portraits she had taken over an eight-year period; he recommended that she enroll at the school and study under him. While at ID, Crane began teaching photography at her alma mater, New Trier High School, chairing and developing the school's photography program through 1967. Months after graduating from ID, she joined the faculty of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she remained until her retirement from teaching in 1995. Crane brought a common element to her role both as artist and educator.\"I have spoken with people who have studied with Barbara at SAIC. They all relate how demanding she was but also how inspiring,\" says Susan Aurinko, photographer and curator of the IIT exhibition. \"I think if Barbara instills anything in her students and followers, it is that fearless spirit with which she herself approaches photography.\"Crane applies this energy to not only her observations on the human form but to images of urban environments and the natural world in single images, grids, groupings, and scrolls. Her innovative photographs have been featured in numerous publications and shows, and are in permanent museum collections across the United States and around the world.While Crane has used cameras ranging from a twin-lens Kodak Reflex\u2014her first serious camera given to her as a gift for her 19th birthday from her parents\u2014to a Deardorff 8\" x 10\" view camera, she has now graduated to the digital age, endeavoring to produce photographs that not only excite her viewers but also that one elusive photograph that truly satisfies her.\"I really love using a camera,\" she says, admitting that she doesn't have one favorite photographic technique from the many she has utilized. \"Some of my photos are better than others but \u2026 it's always the chase. I love to be immersed in photography. Some people travel all over the world; my photography is my travels.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2010/freedom-swimmer", "content": "Late into the night of August 23, 1967, Pedro \"Pete\" Luis Rustan Jr. (EE '70, M.S. '70) leapt from the shores of Communist Cuba into the dark waters of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, swimming one mile to the United States Naval Station and scaling over the Cactus Curtain to freedom.More than 43 years later\u2014with 27 of those years in distinguished service with the United States Air Force\u2014Rustan is still swimming.For many who know Rustan, none would be surprised to learn that the super-achiever was recently offered the position of director of the Mission Support Directorate at thein Chantilly, Va. It will be the third NRO move in six years for Rustan, who has also served as director of Science and Technology as well as director of Ground Enterprise for the organization, which builds and operates the nation's surveillance satellites. In his new role, Rustan works with the community of satellite users\u2014other intelligence agencies, the military, law enforcement, and the, among others\u2014to facilitate the devices' capabilities, including data interpretation and retrieval, the availability of various products, and the types of services offered or types that can be designed to meet a user's needs.When Rustan retired as a United States Air Force colonel in 1997, employment at the NRO was not on his radar. Instead, he became a successful consultant in the private sector, advising companies on matters ranging from potential aerospace projects to the latest technologies for high-speed communications links. Then the September 11 attacks occurred, and in their aftermath Rustan found that his feelings for his new country sent him on a once-familiar course.\"I'm a big patriot,\" he acknowledges, regarding his return to a career in the government in 2003. \"I came from a country that had a lot of problems. I thought, I'd like to pay back the United States for taking me in and giving me everything that I have. What I have is a wonderful life with the freedom to do anything that I want.\"Rustan felt his first rush of liberty after crossing an Opuntia cactus border, which Cuban troops planted along the northeastern edge of the naval base to deter Cubans from attempting to seek refuge in the United States. As luck would have it, Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, then chief of naval operations, was visiting the base; Rustan accompanied him to Miami and was given sanctuary at the Freedom Tower. Miami reminded Rustan too much of Cuba both culturally and politically, so he traveled to Chicago, where he got a job packing televisions for Magnavox. After three short weeks, he moved to the Rockville, Md., area, where his father's friend helped him to obtain a position building computer modules and wiring circuit boards for Control Data Corporation.Supplemented by loans from the Cuban Refugee Program, Rustan earned the down payment on his version of the American Dream: tuition at a prominent technology-focused university. It was something that he had desired ever since the fifth grade, when he and his classmates spent afternoons paging through magazines that featured articles on America's national parks and institutions of higher learning.\"Poverty was my influence,\" he explains. While his family was poor, his parents still found a way to send him to Guant\u00e1namo High School, where he was valedictorian and graduated at age 16. Studying at his classmates' homes, Rustan could not help but notice their televisions and refrigerators, and that their parents had college degrees. \"They had all kinds of things that my father and mother didn't have, so I started working harder because I wanted to have more than what I saw.\"The Cuban government gave Rustan special permission to enter the Universidad de Oriente at 16 as an electrical engineering student; it also gave him his postgraduate assignment\u2014to work in the copper mines, something he had no desire to do. He was required to perform forced labor, cutting sugar cane and harvesting rice and other crops for one month each year. On Saturdays there were military exercises, such as pretend practice in shooting down aircraft or launching missiles. At the same time, the government recognized Rustan's accomplishments in the classroom, where he finished at the top each year, and rewarded him with sightseeing tours around the island. While he enjoyed seeing all of his country, Rustan also witnessed things that further opened his eyes to the deterioration of life in Cuba: sites where nuclear submarine bases were being built for the former Soviet Union.\"By the time I was 19, it became obvious that the situation in Cuba was not going to get any better,\" says Rustan. \"By that time, my father had been a political prisoner for six years, and I was continuously watched throughout college to ensure that I would not become very negative against the revolution and the Cuban government.\"With her son safe in American territory, Rustan's mother smuggled his college transcripts to him, carried in the socks of Cubans who were employed at the naval station. Rustan's diligence earned him entry into all three engineering schools to which he applied\u2014Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Illinois Institute of Technology. Shortly after he entered IIT in 1968, Rustan pledged with the Delta Tau Delta international fraternity.\"The brothers treated me very well,\" he says. \"The fraternity taught me about America\u2014how to eat, how to dress, and how to socialize correctly.\"Rustan's \"Delts\" fraternity brothers also benefited from knowing their new refugee friend. \"He would literally work around the clock to make sure he totally understood every assignment and was totally prepared for every exam,\" says Dave Zook (IE '73), Rustan's \"little brother\" and roommate, now president and owner of Horizontech, Inc. \"He pushed me to work harder, but at the same time, he had a fantastic sense of humor and enjoyed to the fullest the life and the close friendships we had in the fraternity. My fraternity days at IIT were some of the best of my life, and Pete's influence and friendship to a young kid fresh out of high school in Montana were a big reason why.\"Rustan's pledge brother, Gary C. Masterson, business transformation consultant for Spanlink Communications, Inc., gets together with Rustan and a few other Delts every five years or so for Lou Malnati's deep-dish pizza and bridge. Masterson recalls how Rustan and study partner Loren Vogel (IE '72) had desks facing each other topped by hutches that Vogel made. To ensure that Rustan hadn't nodded off, Vogel would periodically light up a cigar and blow smoke at his partner through holes drilled in the hutches. This method apparently achieved its desired effect, and then some.\"Pete provided many of the freshman engineering students in our pledge class with extra tutoring in calculus and physics,\" says Masterson. One young student Rustan tutored in math went on to obtain an advanced degree in the field. Kevin Meade (MAE '74, M.S. AMAT '78), IIT professor of mechanical engineering, was a freshman when Rustan was a graduate student. \"I remember most his passion for math and for engineering,\" says Meade. \"He worked very long hours, never seeming to quit.\"IIT awarded Rustan a scholarship for his master's education, which he was pursuing when the Selective Service called his No. 16 in the draft lottery, beginning his military career. He immediately put his education to use, looking at the effects of electromagnetic interference on pacemakers and publishing his results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Rustan became a citizen in 1971, obtained his doctorate, and as a commissioned officer attained positions of increasing significance in technological research and academia at various military installations.In 1991, Michael Griffin, former NASA administrator, assigned Rustan as program manager for the, whose objectives were to test sensors and spacecraft components used for extended periods in space, and to make scientific observations of the moon and asteroid 1620 Geographos. The mission made the unexpected discovery of finding ice at the lunar South Pole.When Rustan entered the waters of Guantanamo Bay, he shot for the moon, and indeed, hit his target.\"Pete's life story would say, 'Don't give up,' and that improvement is always possible,\" offers Griffin, who left NASA in 2009 and is now an eminent scholar and faculty member at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. \"Set your goals high and then achieve them.

Back at mission control, someone declares, \"Power is everything.\" Even if all other problems are solved, the flight controller explains, without enough power to open the 'chutes on re-entry, the crew is dead.In Terry's view, that spacecraft is a metaphor for our planet, where reserves of non-renewable energy are being depleted rapidly.Terry is a strong advocate for the revival of nuclear energy, which has been largely abandoned in the United States since the late 1970s. \"I like to think that I'm a true environmentalist,\" he says, without irony. He's not alone in this view. Even some career environmentalists\u2014including Scott Howson, chairman of theof the Sierra Club, Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore, and biologist James Lovelock\u2014have spoken out in favor of nuclear development. Thereport of 2007 also gives a cautious nod to nuclear as a \"commercially available climate change mitigating\" technology. It's tough to say they're in love with the idea. But, to paraphrase Winston Churchill's riff on democracy, nuclear may be the worst energy solution\u2014except compared to all the others.Though nuclear power remains a contentious subject, often linked by the public with disasters like Chernobyl and weapons proliferation, the world's growing consumption of energy and increasing awareness of the environmental pitfalls of fossil fuel use are prompting a fresh examination.Trained as a staff scientist at, Terry is an expert on the characterization of radioactive materials and has more than a decade of experience with synchrotron radiation research. In November 2008, he was recruited to run an ambitious new $20 million project known as the Nuclear and Radiological Research Collaborative Access Team, or NRR CAT, at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source. Here, radioactive materials to be used in future nuclear reactors can be studied safely.The work at NRR CAT will represent an important expansion of IIT's longstanding involvement with synchrotron research. Thecame together at IIT in the early 1990s, spurred by the construction of the Advanced Photon Source. Situated just 25 miles southwest of Chicago, APS is the largest synchrotron X-ray source in the western hemisphere.In addition to IIT core members, CSRRI leverages the talents of faculty-researchers university-wide and is involved in collaborations with scientists from around the world. The center is also a training ground for the next generation of nuclear specialists, offering academic coursework as well as training workshops at national and international conferences. The Graduate Assistantships in Areas of National Need Fellowship Program at IIT supports doctoral candidates in physics with a specialization in synchrotron radiation-based research.The synchrotron radiation at Argonne begins with electrons, which are produced by a heated cathode and accelerated to 99.999 percent of the speed of light, using Argonne's linear accelerator. The electrons are then fed into an oval-shaped booster synchrotron to speed them up even further before they are finally injected into the 1,104-meter storage ring, around which they whiz in circles, constrained in their paths by more than 1,000 powerful electromagnets. These speeding electrons produce X-ray beams as they accelerate, decelerate, or change direction. Ports located around the ring allow the streams of X-rays to be sampled and applied to research. The flood of X-rays produced by the APS range in intensity from a thousand to a million times those produced by traditional sources.Such beamlines are used for varied investigations, from the study of semiconductors, magnetic materials, and nanostructures to large biological molecules and new energy technologies, including fuel cells. As Carlo Segre, IIT professor of physics and a member of CSRRI explains, a synchrotron can be thought of as an enormous microscope, able to probe materials at the atomic scale, due to the very short wavelengths of X-rays.Synchrotron technology provides the opportunity to research and refine the materials used in nuclear reactors. \"We're interested, for example, in studying how you make a fuel pellet and encapsulate it so that the uranium and other radioactive materials don't leak out,\" Segre explains. He has also been working with colleagues from the University of Santa Barbara to develop oxygen dispersion strengthened steel, a specialized material containing nanoparticles that exhibits improved performance under radiation conditions. The Advanced Photon Source is an ideal tool to characterize the behavior and appearance of the nanoclusters. This hybrid form of steel could be used eventually to line reactor wall vessels, which must withstand strong irradiation by neutrons.Dan Olive, an IIT graduate student working with Terry, studies how plutonium behaves in the environment, specifically, how it is able to form colloids\u2014chemical mixtures in which particles are suspended. Olive's work addresses nuclear energy's greatest Achilles heel\u2014the problem of radioactive waste. Much of his research is conducted for the U.S. Department of Energy Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or, a storage facility for radioactive materials in Carlsbad, N.M., which has supplanted the Yucca Mountain site, defunded in 2009.Over time, fission products that absorb neutrons during nuclear reactions build up in nuclear fuel, eventually halting the reaction. The fuel must then be removed, though as Terry points out, it still contains most of its energy. \"It's like throwing out the gas tank of your car when it's still three-quarters full because there's air inside of it,\" he says.Though the Salado salt formation, which lies 2,000 feet underground and extends from Kansas to New Mexico, and currently houses the WIPP, is sufficient to store all of the country's nuclear waste for the foreseeable future, most experts agree that there must be a safe and effective means of reprocessing nuclear fuel, if we are to avoid running out of uranium.\"Reprocessing is really the way to go. Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet,\" Olive says. Such reprocessing involves the separation of neutron-absorbing waste byproducts from remaining fissionable material\u2014the uranium or plutonium, which can then be used as reactor fuel. Critics of the procedure fear the diversion of resulting material, which could be used potentially for weapons.According to Aleksandar Ostrogorsky, a new faculty member in IIT's Department of Mechanical, Materials, and Aerospace Engineering, proliferation and other safety concerns are important considerations, but fears may be overblown. He points to a generally positive track record for reactors, noting that most U.S. water-cooled and moderated reactor designs\u2014pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors\u2014are safer than the Russian graphite pile device involved in the Chernobyl disaster. As for the threat of proliferation, Ostrogorsky notes that a number of countries now have access to the Zippe-type centrifuges and the know-how for enriching uranium, or they could use plutonium produced in their own reactors without having to pilfer supplies from U.S. reactors.Ostrogorsky, who worked in the field of nuclear engineering from 1977\u2013 1982, is currently involved in research funded by the(within the DOE) into a new generation of high-resolution gamma ray detectors that can keenly sense nuclear radiation. Such technology is widely applicable to many fields and may be used in future reactors for radiation monitoring.In terms of environmental friendliness, nuclear energy is sandwiched between emission-free alternatives like solar and wind, and carbon-emitting technologies\u2014including public enemy No. 1, the coal-fired power plant, which supplies the U.S. with more than 50 percent of its electricity but also is the leading source of mercury pollution and toxic particulates. The basic mode of power generation with each of these is the conversion of energy from one form into another. As Segre explains, both nuclear and conventional coal-fired plants rely on thermodynamic processes to heat water and use it to drive giant, magnetized turbines that generate electricity.In the case of nuclear, the process works on the principle that very heavy elements like uranium are unstable. The uranium nucleus is held together by a specific energy, known as the binding energy, which is released in the form of gamma rays, neutrons, and kinetic energy when the nucleus is torn apart into more stable constituents.Fission reactors use pellets of uranium, including the radioactive isotope U-235, encased in fuel rods. In the reactor's core, fissionable uranium undergoes a controlled chain reaction, releasing energy in the form of heat, turning pressurized water into pressurized steam to drive the electricity-producing turbines. The advantage over a coal plant is that during actual operation, there are no toxic emissions or CO2 released from smokestacks (though some CO2 is involved in the mining of uranium ore, refining, and enriching fuel, and construction of the plant itself). The disadvantage is that spent fuel persists at the end of its cycle as a long-lasting hazardous waste that must either be stored or reprocessed.The current energy picture is alarming. As Terry notes, fossil fuels today deliver 86 percent of our energy. Of the remaining 14 percent, roughly 40 percent is nuclear and about 20 percent is hydroelectric. Biomass is used much more widely than renewables like solar, geothermal, or wind power. \"When we're talking biomass,\" Terry explains, \"we mean people who are cutting down trees or plants and burning them to survive.\"Nuclear energy will not provide a panacea for the world's energy woes.At best, it will be a slice of the new energy portfolio, which seeks to offset nearly all of the world's fossil fuels by mid-century, if goals set by the IPCC are to be met. Atmospheric CO2 must be driven down and held to below 350\u2013450 parts per million. The alternative, we are warned, is continued warming of the planet, with unknown and potentially catastrophic consequences.Given these sobering estimates, one may wonder why carbon-reducing platforms, including nuclear, are not at the forefront of the nation's agenda. As chairman and chief executive officer of Exelon, owner of the country's largest fleet of nuclear reactors, IIT Board of Trustees Chairhas been pondering these issues throughout a lengthy career. He emphasizes that despite the gathering awareness of our energy predicament, new reactors continue to face daunting economic and political hurdles.For the past 30 years or so, nuclear construction has languished due to a combination of public resistance and exorbitant cost. In addition, bureaucratic tangles from siting to reactor design approval and licensing are formidable, requiring about a decade for completion of a new plant. Though there has been some movement on Capitol Hill of late, Rowe remains skeptical. \"Unfortunately, at the present time the only thing that's cheap is burning natural gas,\" he says, adding that convincing, bipartisan commitment to nuclear energy has yet to materialize.Rowe says the prospects for meeting some of the more ambitious goals, which call for 350,000 megawatts of additional, carbon-free electrical energy by 2030, are bleak. \"It's not going to happen,\" he insists, noting that 50,000 megawatts of additional nuclear by 2030 might be feasible. In the first 10 years of nuclear redevelopment, only 8,000\u201310,000 megawatts are projected, based on the construction of four to eight new plants. Rowe says an essential first step is the passage of aggressive climate legislation with incentives for carbon-free energy coupled with some system of cap and trade to limit carbon emissions.In the second half of the century solar will have to play a very large role, but presently solar is uneconomic, at least without massive subsidies. Exelon estimates place natural gas at roughly $10 a ton of avoided CO2, whereas new nuclear comes in at around $70 and wind varies from $50\u201380 per ton. Offsetting CO2 through sequestration or solar energy is even pricier. \"I think it's terribly important that the first four to eight plants get built,\" Rowe stresses. \"If they don't, we're not going to have a good base for building the 14 to 20 that we'll need going into the next decade.\"In the wake of the December 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, an increasing sense of urgency permeates discussion of our energy future. As demands for cleaner energy become ever more acute, the DOE hopes to expand its research base, with an eye toward maintaining existing nuclear facilities while paving the way for a new generation of reactors and safer means of disposing spent fuel. The NRR CAT project holds promise to be a valuable research element within the DOE's developing energy plan. In the meantime, our daily energy consumption adds to the roughly 10 billion metric tons of carbon expelled into the atmosphere annually. According to the Energy Information Administration'sfor 2008, America's overall energy use is expected to grow by nearly 19 percent by 2030 while electricity demand alone is projected to climb by 30 percent during the same period. And every ton of CO2 released into the atmosphere lingers there for a century\u2014some of it for thousands of years. Turning the carbon tide will be slow.A profound transformation in the way the world acquires and uses energy has barely begun. According to the IPCC's 2007 report on climate change, world carbon output should ideally peak in just five years, before beginning a steep descent. The U.S. and other wealthy nations\u2014the leading carbon polluters\u2014need to slash carbon emissions 25\u201340 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, at a minimum. Added to the dilemma\u2014rapid industrialization in the developing world and increasing population growth. \"If we stay on this course and add another 4 billion people,\" Olive warns, \"then even if we turn off our electricity and the U.S. goes dark, it won't matter.\" Global management of CO2 is imperative, and new industrialization must be predicated on low carbon or carbon-free alternatives.Today, concern for the environment\u2014one of the very issues responsible for tabling nuclear energy three decades ago\u2014may help drive the development of new reactors. It's an irony not lost on those involved in the nuclear field, as attempts are made to address what some authorities on climate change call the greatest challenge our species has ever faced.Research into the behavior of radioactive materials, such as the new work planned for NRR CAT, will begin laying the groundwork for a nuclear renaissance, when it comes. If it comes. Political and economic barriers are wed to many remaining technological trials. \"No one has yet had a eureka moment,\" Terry says, adding after a pause, \"Boy, do we need one.\"Global campaign to reduce carbon:Exelon's 2020 low-carbon roadmap:Technology behind nuclear reactors:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010/united-we-serve", "content": "In the 1957 film adaptation of the play, actors Lee J.

She also served as symposium editor of \"The 50th Anniversary of,\" published in the. The symposium is one of several on juries she has selected as resources offered through a new online informational clearinghouse she is creating called the.Her deep and long-time interest in juries goes back to her first year as a student at Yale Law School and the strong impression made on her by a professor who favored bench trials over jury trials. She went on to publish her first piece at Yale on the topic of juries and gender dynamics and had opportunities to work on cases that pertained to juries as a law clerk in a federal district court, a court of appeals, and finally, for Justice John Paul Stevens at the U. S. Supreme Court.The idea for a jury clearinghouse came to Marder several years ago when she could not find one centralized website for jury information and grew increasingly frustrated with sites that only featured articles that were not current.\"I see the Jury Center as being a broadly defined public service,\" she explains, adding that academics, students, the media, and interested citizens could all benefit from visiting the site. \"It would be one way to make available a lot of information such as current scholarship, new developments, and upcoming conferences\u2014all pertaining to the jury.\"Working with third-year law student Amanda Schackart, Marder began constructing the site in fall 2009. It features annotated bibliographies of journal articles on comparative jury systems, the history of juries, jury behavior, jury selection, and public policy; published symposia; and links to other jury resources, such as the. For the future, Marder is looking to involve the Jury Center in an empirical study, which would provide a real-world plus to Illinois jurors by helping to shape practice and redesign procedures.Marder says that a current topic of interest is the growing number of countries that want to encourage citizens' participation in the justice system and are considering the jury as one way to do so.\"Jury trials remain important,\" says Marder. \"People take very seriously their right to a jury trial in this country.\" She hopes this growing international interest in the jury will mean that the new Jury Center will provide valuable information for people across the globe."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010/be-willing-walk-away", "content": "Cheryl Hyman (CS '96), the new chancellor of City Colleges of Chicago, would tell you that there's \nno such thing as a free lunch. But there was a time in her life when she did accept the generosity of a home-cooked meal, a shoulder to lean on, and a bed shared with her maternal grandmother.Even at the age of 10, when she pounded out a letter to President Ronald Reagan in protest over the firing of thousands of striking air traffic controllers, Hyman aspired to run the world not just differently, but better.\"We're born with a certain spirit that will help to carry us to \nwhere we need to be,\" says Hyman, still expressing some disappointment that she learned only a few years ago that her letter was never mailed.That spirit-and, she would later acknowledge, something \"much higher than anything on this Earth\"-carried her through the tough times that began when Hyman realized her mother was sinking further into drug addiction and her stepfather into alcoholism. She began spending less time at home and more time in her car, where she tried reading her school texts while parked under a streetlight. Angry and searching for stability in her life, Hyman left her home on the West Side of Chicago.She also left Orr High School during her senior year and took a full-time job at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Hyman was able to afford the rent on a studio apartment but soon realized that nothing would take the place of a high school diploma and college degree. She turned to a friend's mother known for her generosity and kindness, who offered Hyman a place to live, a balanced environment, and the chance to return to school. She graduated from Orr at 19 and moved in with her grandmother.Being reunited with a strong and comforting member of her family gave Hyman a feeling of security, allowing her to explore her educational interests further. Although her exposure to computers had been minimal, Hyman was drawn to technical subjects. She took a few vocational courses in computer science before speaking with an admission counselor at the local university she had heard was the best in her discipline of choice-IIT.\"One of the things I dearly would like is to learn the name of that counselor, to personally thank him for his help,\" says Hyman, about the staff member who suggested that she first attend a two-year college. \"He could have very well looked down on me, but he instead encouraged me to go to a community college first to ensure that it was a proper bridge.\"Hyman followed his recommendation and enrolled at Olive-Harvey College, one of the institutions she now oversees. After transferring to IIT, she quickly excelled, working with computer science faculty member George Smith to design laboratory tutorials on the C++ computer-programming language. She also obtained a position running a computer laboratory at the nonprofit Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which would inspire her to become involved in community service work one day. Her heart began to open \nwidely enough to even forgive her mother, Katherine McMurty, who came knocking on the door of the new apartment Hyman lived in while she was still an IIT student. With her daughter's support, McMurty kicked her drug habit and saw Hyman graduate on December 15, 1996.The next day, Hyman began a career at ComEd that lasted for the next 14 years. From her initial position as a development analyst responsible for maintaining and enhancing nuclear-related legacy applications, Hyman advanced to external affairs manager, director of government and legislative affairs, and vice president of operations strategy and business intelligence. Along the way, she added to her academic credentials, earning an executive M.B.A. from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and an M.A. in community development from North Park University.Throughout Hyman's corporate climb, her desire to give back to her community only intensified. She established a mentoring program between ComEd and the Boys and Girls Clubs; ComEd also earmarked money for the purchase of laptop computers for at-risk students and expanded a computer laboratory at one of the clubs. She left ComEd for one summer as part of an executive-on-loan program and helped to obtain nearly 1,000 seasonal jobs for low-income youth in the Chicago area.\"Cheryl is a smart, hard-charging executive who takes nothing for granted,\" says John W. Rowe, chairman and chief executive officer of Exelon Corporation, parent company of ComEd. \"She is driven by her passion for results and her even larger passion for the community.\"While she also reached out through volunteer work at organizations such as The Night Ministry for the homeless and The Black Star Project for excellence in education, she became increasingly discontent with giving just a few hours of her time each week to a few select causes. Hyman spent her last year at ComEd in spiritual contemplation of what she felt was missing in a life that was seemingly full and complete. Then Mayor Richard M. Daley invited her to consider the chancellor role. She knew what her answer would be.\"If you really want to do something, be willing to walk away from your glorious life and put yourself into the solution,\" says the forthright Hyman, about her decision. \"I've never had such a big challenge, yet never felt so spiritually fulfilled. We get to a certain place in our lives and think that we are not obligated to help fix humanity's problems. We put it on the police or on the legislators-we put it on everybody but ourselves. If anybody thinks they've been brought out of a situation like mine just for the sake of his or her own benefit, they are sadly mistaken.\"Hyman endeavors to have City Colleges of Chicago serve as both an academic entry point and source of vocational training for students. She maintains that in its dual role the system-which comprises seven institutions with an enrollment of more than 120,000 students-has the capability to be Chicago's economic anchor. \nWhile she acknowledges enrollment is important, Hyman believes that numbers are not the only indication of success. What also matters is the time that individuals at the colleges can give to truly listen to the diverse needs of students and how well the institution has responded.\"Did the students complete what they came here for and did it fulfill their purpose? Did their lives improve?\" Hyman poses these questions as qualitative benchmarks of success. With no less expectation for herself, Hyman also sets forth a personal gauge, one she will eagerly monitor.\"How much further do I need to go to help a student? I can now do everything I've ever wanted to do to change the life of a student. My job is the ultimate in service work,\" she says with a broad smile. \"I am doing what I love.\"City Colleges of Chicago:The Night Ministry:The Black Star Project:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010/life-pictures", "content": "Steven Poster's career epiphany arrived in a vintage Jaguar, in the form of a pipe-smoking, bearded stranger who emerged from behind the wheel to survey the vacant lot next to Poster's boyhood home. Hanging from a cord around the driver's neck was an object the 14-year-old amateur photographer instantly recognized: a light meter. Already inspired by photography, home movies, and the technology behind them, Poster knew then what he wanted to be when he grew up.\"Morrie Bleckman was the coolest guy I had ever seen,\" says Poster, about the newsreel cameraman for CBS Broadcasting, Inc., who was building a house on the property in Lincolnwood, Ill., and would become a lifelong mentor. \"The moment I met him and found out what he did, I decided that I wanted to be a cinematographer.\"Today, Poster (DSGN '67) has a reputation for being a skillful technologist with a repertoire of cross-genre film work to his credit. He has partnered with such directors as Ridley Scott (Someone to Watch Over Me), Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko), and Rob Minkoff, with whom he recently collaborated on the film Flypaper starring Patrick Dempsey.During his final year at IIT Institute of Design, Poster began working first as an assistant and then quickly was asked to shoot commercials. He also had the opportunity to work with Herschel Gordon Lewis\u2014the creator of \"gore\" films\u2014who was based in the Windy City. Poster had one of his first Hollywood experiences when he served as second-unit cameraman for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.A member of the American Society of Cinematographers, Poster is national president of the International Cinematographers Guild and is considered to be an industry spokesman for the changes in technology in the film industry. With the rise of digital and 3-D cinematography, Poster has mandated that guild members be trained to meet the industry's needs. In 2009, the guild held 27 education programs in various technologies with the most popular this year being a course in 3-D techniques offered in conjunction with the Sony Corporation.Poster says a one-size-fits-all approach is not part of the formula for creating the next Hollywood blockbuster. Flypaper is being shot digitally while this summer's action-filled Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, which Poster worked on with director Brad Peyton, was shot in 35mm film but converted into 3-D.\"It's complex and cumbersome to shoot in 3-D; it's very technologically difficult,\" he says. \"It's so difficult that none of us felt that the animals would respond well to that approach. The computer animation of the faces of the cats and dogs is just tremendous, however. The technology, in just 10 years, has come so far. It's remarkable.\"Steven Poster has been influential in the use of digital technology for the motion picture industry for more than two decades. In 1990, he was selected to perform a test shoot with one of the first High-Definition television systems for Japan's NHK Television. Poster describes his selections for the top technological advances in cinematography in the past decade:\"The quality and sensitivity has increased 1,000-fold over the past 10\u201315 years,\" says Poster, noting that as a result of these improvements, more \nefficient digital technology has developed to reproduce high-quality motion picture images.Poster says that until recently, the only way a color movie image could be made electronically was through the use of multiple chips, or light sensors, that were designated to represent red, blue, and green light, resulting in a color image when combined through a prism. \"With new image-gathering technology that captures the full spectrum on a single chip, digital images can represent the high-quality images we are used to seeing on film,\" he says.Poster says that the ability to both laser-scan images from film and run digital files through a color-correcting system is significant. \"Almost every element of every single frame can now be manipulated,\" he adds. \"This allows us as cinematographers to complete our art, as if we were going into a darkroom with a black-and-white enlarger and making a print.

But for an IIT alumna, and a group of IIT students and their faculty mentor, it was an opportunity to build bridges and to touch the divine.In January 2008, the Reverend Dankwart Moser-Feesche, a minister from the Odenwald/Bauland region of southern Germany, approached architect(M.Arch. '99) with his vision for an ecumenical chapel. Except for an idea about what the building would represent and where it should be located\u2014in Boedigheim\u2014he had no other resources to offer, not even the support of his congregation. Ecker immediately thought of, her longtime friend and IIT associate professor of architecture, who has established a far-reaching reputation for his unique Advanced Design/Build Studio course projects. Flury's collaborative pro bono efforts have given his students invaluable hands-on experience and members of various communities the chance to enjoy new buildings, or rebuilt and improved structures.\"Frank's studio has designed and built diverse projects in the United States that have had a positive social impact,\" says Ecker. \"The reverend's chapel seemed to be viable possibility for the students at IIT to execute an international project for the first time.\"With Flury on board, Ecker explains, the multinational team took a \"divide and conquer\" approach in sharing responsibilities. During spring 2009, Flury and his 12 architecture students\u2014from seven different states across the country and China\u2014decided upon a design for the chapel and corresponded with Ecker's firm, Ecker Architekten, via email, AutoCAD, and Skype teleconferencing to translate the design into a set of drawings that met or exceeded German construction standards. The reverend and local community members contributed to the project by acquiring property rights as well as accommodations for their American visitors. After Ecker's office obtained the necessary building permits, the IIT team arrived in Germany in June to break ground and to build, with the help of local craftsmen, volunteer workers, and townspeople.Ecker lives near the site and often drives by the Field Chapel, which is made entirely of wood obtained from the local forests; the structure is surrounded by four closed walls and has views open to the sky and the tower that comprises the sanctuary. She says she finds it remarkable that the IIT students were able to create such a special space of reflection and silence, whose sole occupant is light. She also thinks about another significant aspect of the building.\"The project has found positive resonance and a sense of pride and ownership in all of the participating municipalities; diverse groups have collaborated to create something not possible separately,\" she says. \"This means that the students, Reverend Moser-Feesche, Frank, and I were building more than a chapel. We were building bridges between neighbors within the community.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2017/it-all-begins-pencil", "content": "Whether a graphite nub or a sleek mechanical model, the style of sketching instrument matters little to Maimuna Binta Antoinette Venzant (TCOM '16), whose anime-inspired illustrations are often as poetic as her name.

Venzant was a quick learner and added to her skillset through senior year of high school, when she decided to put aside her \"hobby\" and instead focus on her pre-med biology major at Illinois Tech. Her courses seemed daunting and not quite the right fit, and Venzant wondered if she could convince her parents, who had a huge appreciation and drive for science and technology, to allow her to pursue a career in art. Venzant tried out computer science for one year and still felt frustrated until she spoke with her advisor, who thought that technical communication would satisfy Venzant's pull toward both science and the humanities.\"Technical communication required that I take a lot of web design courses, which were electives in the computer science major. I learned that I really enjoyed designing websites,\" she says, noting that she also felt that she was moving toward the right career path of choice.Venzant built up herwhile completing her Illinois Tech degree, occasionally taking on small commissions such as the art she produced for thefeature \".\" Her aesthetic for the story relied upon equal parts head and heart.\"I looked at what idea would need to be conveyed in a specific situation and the emotions that should be expressed,\" she says, noting that it helps her to determine how much darkness or shadow she should use. \"Narrow angles depict a more threatening message; a more rounded and brighter depiction signifies a calm state. I rough sketched the first thing that came to my mind. When Carly [Kocurek] described falling down in yoga class, I thought about how that would make me feel because it's a similar feeling for everybody. I have a lot of art books and movies that I like, so I think of a favorite scene, how it was directed, and why the director did it that specific way.\"Other than a pencil, Venzant does all of her work in Adobe Photoshop, including colorization. Nonetheless, she longs to see the film and television industry return to 2-D animation, the traditional process of one hand-drawn image following the other at 24 images per second. Much of the industry has adopted 3-D animation, with computer object-models replacing frames. Even though the 2-D process is more laborious, it immerses her in what she loves doing and allows her to better know the character she is creating.\"I'd much prefer to work on shorts or films rather than computer games,\" says Venzant, whose dream is to one day own a small animation company where she could give her staff the freedom to experiment outside established industry standards. \"There's something about seeing a film on a huge screen that makes me feel completely enveloped by it.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010/slideshow-spring-iit-main-campus", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2017/two-can-play-game", "content": "\"I had saved up $2,000 in babysitting money to buy myself an Apple II Plus computer that I could use at home to program in assembly language, but my parents wouldn't let me buy it because they thought it would be a passing phase,\" says(M.S.

She was addicted to her Atari 2600 and Game Boy consoles growing up, but turned to the social side of gaming as a graduate student, when she began to explore the intersections of gender, technology, and gaming. After conceptualizing and producing the internationally exhibited serious computer gamewhich she created in 2014 to encourage dialogue about reproductive health care access issues, Kocurek and her controversial subject garnered attention that was not always welcome.\"I was so glad that I got only six hateful emails and 40 YouTube comments about how I was going to be murdered instead of thousands,\" recalls Kocurek, the green streaks in her hair the same shade as her retro cat-eye eyeglass frames.

Smart phones and other mobile/wireless devices attracted 36 percent of the most frequent gamers, with 38 percent of them playing puzzle, board game, card game, and game show games, many comprising the casual game genre.\"We started making casual games before anyone seemed to notice that it was a legitimate genre,\" says Dominiak, whose company has produced old-school time-passers such as mahjong, crosswords, and hangman for platforms ranging from Nintendo and Windows/Mac OSX to mobile phones, and recently released the latest version of thecard game. \"Now they're dominating everything, in online stores and in regular retail, because people of different ages and backgrounds are playing, and not everyone likes to play the same game.\"More and more game players, however, are dipping their fingers into the realm of virtual reality, with 55 percent of the most frequent players already familiar with the concept and 58 percent intending to play games utilizing this latest technology.\"Instead of having a headset over your eyes the hardware is going to plug into your brain. It's coming,\" says Dominiak. \"There are already scientists who are able to project images through the optic nerve and into the brain.\"Kocurek adds that she is interested in augmented reality, a technology that adds computer-generated sound, graphics, or video to a real-world environment to make for a more valuable user experience. Dominiak notes that such technology can have a disingenuous side, however. While VR incorporates the use of a headset, AR devices exist that mimic contact lenses.\"It'sof ethics stuff, right?\" says Kocurek.\"Yeah, we're going to start merging with the machines, too. We're not going to just be individuals; it's going to be us and something else\u2014and then we're really not going to be human anymore,\" Dominiak adds.While society at large is far from the dystopian civilization of the Aldous Huxley futuristic classic, Dominiak, the computer scientist, finds compelling technical reasons why students, especially women, should overcome fears that may be holding them back from making much-needed contributions to the Digital Age.\"Artificial intelligence, computers, virtual reality\u2014these things are taking over planet Earth, and I mean, literally. We need programmers now more than ever. If women don't become developers or become involved in technology, they are putting themselves in peril,\" cautions Dominiak. \"They are not in charge of their own destiny if they don't embrace technology and become a part of what is to come. Are we going to become a planet with robots that go around shooting the enemy? Or are we going to become a planet with robots that are benevolent and help each other? We should have a vote. But if we stay out of the field, we're not going to have a vote.\"Kocurek, the historian, finds another reason, one that perhaps speaks to humankind on a deeper level. As part of the research she is doing on a book about Atari gaming pioneer, Kocurek had the chance to read Laurel's laboratory notes and could almost share in the emotions Laurel and her team conveyed on the development of the novel form of entertainment.\"There was such a sense of opportunity and that they could provide something that was transformative, not just because it was such fun, but because it gave people a sense of wonder and awe in doing something new,\" Kocurek explains. \"I think there is something delicious about that.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/obituaries", "content": "Ph.D. MET '63Professor and Chair EmeritusArlington Heights, IllinoisOne year after graduating from Illinois Institute of Technology, Norman N.

Daley has left City Hall after a 22-year term as Chicago's mayor, perhaps he'll spend some time retracing his steps, recalling the Chicago that he knew when he became mayor in 1989.He'd hardly recognize the corner of State Street and 35th Street.That intersection, and the rest of the IIT campus, is radically, positively different than when Daley took office. The university has been transformed during his tenure, beginning the year he took office, when IIT received an $8 million grant to transform its campus and neighborhood. That touched off two decades of exceptional growth, and now there is brimming confidence and surging optimism on campus.Here's how IIT has changed.Certainly, if you're describing the changes to IIT's Main Campus, you have to include the extraordinary buildings: the Helmut Jahn-designed student residence, State Street Village (2003); The McCormick Tribune Campus Center, designed by Rem Koolhaas (2003); and the renovation of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's landmark S. R. Crown Hall (2005).But the transformation of IIT isn't only physical, it's cultural. At SSV, the entryways are punctuated by the contrast between corrugated metal and birch trees\u2014not to mention an array of flyers promoting student activities and organizations. The bold colors and angles of MTCC are striking, but what really grabs your attention is that hundreds of students are on hand at lunchtime. Some are spinning records at campus radio station WIIT, some are setting up trick shots on pool tables, while others are meeting in conference rooms or working at computer stations. At Crown Hall, the renovation has revitalized Mies' original architecture and makes the interior more visible to passersby, allowing them to see not only the building's glass-and-steel facade, but also the student projects inside.One reason that Main Campus is more active is there are more students: 2,437 full-time undergraduates in fall 2010, up from 1,794 in 1991. The shift is even more dramatic among graduate students, with 2,221 full-time grad students on Main Campus in fall 2010, compared to 546 two decades ago. (Fall 2011 enrollment figures were unavailable as of press date.)\"More people want access, and more people want to be social,\" says Angela Ng (CE '11), outgoing president of the student activities organization Union Board, which weighs event requests from more than 100 student organizations.Walk through campus on a spring afternoon and, as you enjoy the new landscaping, you'll probably also have to dodge Frisbees\u2014the disc golf course can draw a crowd, as can Ultimate Frisbee games at Siegel Field.\"The growth we've had is fantastic; some of the changes that have happened on campus in the last few years have been hugely successful,\" says Brian Kibbe (MMAE 5th year), former student body president. He says the task now is to make on-campus activities a focal point of the IIT experience.In 2001, police served as escorts for David Baker and the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Board up 17 unlit flights of stairs in the Stateway Gardens projects adjacent to IIT. It was clear to Baker, IIT's vice president for external affairs, that this was no way to live, and that there had to be a better alternative.Ten years later, the buildings are gone. They've been replaced by a mixed-use, mixed-income development that includes condos, duplexes, and single-family homes where CHA residents live alongside professionals and IIT students. Three staples of college-town retail businesses have also opened on 35th Street: a coffeehouse, a sandwich shop, and a pizza place. (According to IIT Vice President for Community Affairs and Outreach Programs Leroy Kennedy, Mayor Daley himself stood in IIT Tower a decade ago, pointed down at the intersection, and proclaimed that it should have a Starbucks; now it does.)IIT graduate students Tabitha Ponte and Bobby Zylstra are sitting by the windows in the Starbucks that now stands at the corner, reviewing plans for their nonprofit named 26Lab, which trains high school students in architecture, engineering, and construction by putting them to work on real-world projects in Bridgeport and Bronzeville. IIT's Idea Shop hosted the pilot program.There is still plenty of need, as well as plenty of opportunity, to serve in this neighborhood. But Ponte and Zylstra agree that the community already has changed to the extent that they feel they can make a difference\u2014as opposed to, say, a decade ago, when the buildings at the south end of campus were damaged from spillover violence from the public housing projects, and Baker encouraged students not to venture too close to 35th Street.Now, the area \"is on the brink of significant transformation,\" Ponte says. One milestone came in 2000, when the City of Chicago relocated its police headquarters to 3510 South Michigan Avenue. Another came in 2007, when the demolition of the Robert Taylor Homes public housing towers was completed.IIT has also reached out to its neighbors by building relationships with community organizations and supporting initiatives such as 26Lab. The university also helps to run a charter middle/high school, the Perspectives/IIT Math and Science Academy.For Baker, it has been a rewarding journey as he and IIT's leaders have gone from \"wringing our hands about our location\" in the 1990s to now excitedly envisioning the next steps for the revitalization of Bronzeville, Bridgeport, and the campus itself. It has been a collective effort between the campus and community, and the university has spearheaded numerous projects to enhance local parks, homes, schools, and roadways.Longtime residents have noticed the change as well. The neighborhood is \"a melting pot, and [the physical changes] have stirred it very effectively,\" says Leonard McGee, president of the Gap Community Organization, noting that IIT students and faculty are much more visible east of campus nowadays. He says the community has a ways to go, but is on the right track: \"We're moving down the road. We're not moving real fast yet, but we're moving down the road, and I think there is a genuine commitment on [IIT's] part to be even more involved and more engaged.\"Baker agrees: \"It's been a radical change. We've transitioned to the point where now the only question is, 'What is this neighborhood going to grow up to be?'\"\"In a couple of years, [a green campus] will be a litmus test,\" says Joseph Clair (M.S. MAE '95), IIT's director of campus energy and sustainability. \"Colleges will have to meet a certain standard to be considered by students of this generation.\"IIT is on pace to far exceed that baseline.The Princeton Review rated IIT one of the two greenest university campuses in Illinois last year. Campus projects range from an award-winning recycling program to a food-composting program, to bicycle rental stations that arrived in the spring, and 10 electric-vehicle charging stations.Other eco-friendly initiatives apply IIT's engineering focus to advancing sustainable technologies. Most prominent among these is Perfect Power, a joint project of IIT and the U.S. Department of Energy that is replacing the power grid on campus with a series of micro-grids that will be more efficient and more reliable. The first of four phases is complete, and project leaders estimate that the university will save between $500,000 and $1.5 million annually on its energy bills. Perfect Power also will benefit the IIT graduate students who have the opportunity to research the system.The university also installed a small wind turbine next to Stuart Field at the north end of campus in July so that engineers can study its operation and reliability.Clair believes the greening of Main Campus also reflects a growing sense of connection between the university community and its surroundings.\"People are taking care of the neighborhood and the campus, and people take care of things when they feel a sense of ownership. As an alum, my sense is that IIT seems to care more about being here than it used to,\" he says.David Hacker is looking for dead spots at the southern edge of IIT's Main Campus at 35th and State streets. Once upon a time, it would have been easy enough; back then, IIT's students and faculty didn't often venture to this corner, which it shared with the Chicago Housing Authority's Stateway Gardens projects. But now, the area is bustling with the activity of students, shoppers, homeowners, and even the employees of high-tech businesses at IIT's tech-business incubator, University Technology Park.Hacker is the director of engineering for ProOnGo LLC, a software company that makes an expense-tracking app for mobile phones. And the dead spots he's seeking aren't visual, but instead are gaps in the cellular network: He's testing a new version of the ProOnGo app for BlackBerry.The company moved to IIT in 2008. Chief Executive Officer Phil Leslie chose the location even though he isn't an IIT grad. He was drawn to UTP because its proximity to campus provided him access to the skilled programmers who study at IIT. At any given time, ProOnGo employs from two to seven IIT graduate students, offering them a chance to write the code behind the apps in the phones of ProOnGo's 250,000 registered users.\"We get to be the center of attention here a little bit, and that's fun,\" says Leslie. \"Our interns are pumped to be able to write iPhone code that ships to real customers. It's a matter of pride.\"ProOnGo is just one of the businesses based at UTP. The biotech firm Chromatin, Inc., which has raised more than $10 million in funding, is also there. Cleversafe, Inc., a cloud security firm, grew from three to 35 employees while at IIT; now based in downtown Chicago, the company raised $31.4 million in funding last year.There are several compelling views from the platform at the new Metra stop adjacent to IIT's Main Campus. Look east, and you can see the shops of Park Boulevard, the mixed-use residential and retail development at 35th and State streets. Look west, and you can see the outfield bleachers at U.S. Cellular Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. South, you can see down the Dan Ryan expressway for what seems like halfway to Indiana. The northern view, of course, is of Chicago's skyline.The cumulative, panoramic impression is of a campus that is ideally situated within a developing neighborhood and a world-class city. Already, the State Street bus and two recently renovated \"El\" lines (Red and Green Lines) run through the heart of campus. The Dan Ryan also makes Main Campus easily accessible by car.Now the Metra, a commuter train, provides an even faster mode of transportation to campus from the suburbs. The new Metra stop, which opened in April, \"confirms that IIT is one of the most conveniently located urban universities in the country,\" according to Vice President for External Affairs David Baker. \"We have gone from being perceived as an outlier in the 1990s to now being in the center. People are realizing, 'Wow, it's so easy to get [to IIT] from anywhere in the city.' This Metra stop is the next step.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/alumni-news", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2010/endless-possibilities", "content": "The first thing that strikes you when you see the new Idea Shop at IIT's University Technology Park is the wide-open space-all 13,000 square feet of it. The area is designed to stimulate creative, team-based projects, so flexibility and roominess were core design principles. Clearly, there's plenty of space for big ideas.The expansiveness speaks directly to the purpose of the Idea Shop, which is to facilitate innovation and collaboration without constraint. The shop itself is a prime example of the sort of work it is intended to foster. By June, only a few months after the space became available, it was fully operational and already as high-tech a space as existed on Main Campus, with eight Mac mini-powered projectors mounted to the ceilings and every wall covered with a special writeable paint that allows students to scrawl their ideas directly on the wall.\"The space has helped tremendously,\" says Alyssa Walther (ME 4th year), who is using the Idea Shop as part of a course in the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program, IIT's 15-year-old, flagship team-based academic program that joins students from a variety of majors to study real-world problems. Walther and her classmates are attempting to design and market a new type of fishhook. \"Right away, we had all four walls filled with information-dates, times, tasks. And the space is arranged so that we're all facing each other, which is a big change from having to rearrange all of our desks [which would be necessary in a traditional classroom]. It saves time and is good for communication within our team.\"One of Walther's instructors, Senior Lecturer David Gatchell, agrees and is excited about the arrival of additional rapid-prototyping equipment. (The Idea Shop already boasts two 3-D prototyping machines and a laser cutter, but more equipment is on the way.) Gatchell says the ability to generate product prototypes quickly will be especially useful for students, who, unlike professionals, do not work together all week and thus benefit greatly from enhanced productivity during their twice-weekly meetings.\"You can sketch things, you can do things theoretically, and you can model things computationally. But it's not until you see that three-dimensional manifestation of an object that you can say, 'Okay, I now see what we're missing,' and move on to the next step,\" Gatchell explains. \"Design is an iterative process, and if you can rapidly prototype and get that first mockup done, then you can rapidly move on to the second, third, and fourth prototype, until you get to that nth mockup that might actually be the one you're looking for.\"The process that Gatchell and his students are pursuing is \"design thinking\"-a designer's approach to innovation and creative problem-solving-something IIT hopes to emphasize at the Idea Shop and in its IPRO courses.Design thinking \"is a process of defining a problem, researching it, analyzing it, forming and synthesizing insights, and then coming up with ideas for solutions,\" says Tom Jacobius, IIT's director of interprofessional studies and the IPRO director. From there, \"you prototype those solutions and plan a path forward to realize innovation.\"IIT's leaders believe that design thinking is beneficial for and applicable to students in all disciplines\u2014either as a primary mode of problem solving or, minimally, a complementary one. The university's 2009 strategic plan envisions fostering a unique educational experience at IIT that is defined by creativity, leadership, entrepreneurship, innovation, and the design process. The plan emphasizes both interdisciplinary collaboration and more work that fuses education and research.IPRO courses such as the one featuring the fishhook project are prime examples of that sort of experience, just as the Idea Shop exemplifies a space designed to cultivate such experiences. The educational method is called \"open-ended, project-based learning\"\u2014something that IIT has emphasized in the past.Open-ended learning refers to projects in which the student defines and pursues a path of exploration, often pursuing a creative means of solving a problem with no preconceived solution. Such work requires students to develop hypotheses, test theories, adapt to changing variables, and prototype and test potential solutions, which fosters advanced learning and cognitive development. In the process, students also develop teamwork and leadership skills.The principles of open-ended, project-based learning incorporate many elements of design thinking, an area in which IIT has a strategic advantage. Design thinking is central to the university's legacy, dating from the IIT tenures of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, leaders of the influential Bauhaus design movement of the early twentieth century, to today, at IIT's top-ranked Institute of Design.Because this style of learning is a focus of IIT's academic platform, in some ways it is no surprise that the Idea Shop came together so quickly. Even though the university identified the Idea Shop's ultimate home only this year, the concept of the shop dates back a decade. It received a jolt in 2008, when provost Alan Cramb joined the university and was given a tour by Mike Gosz, vice provost for undergraduate affairs.During the tour, the pair visited the traditional campus highlights, but Gosz also took Cramb to an open space, off the beaten path on the fourth floor of Machinery Hall. It wasn't exactly a showplace, but Gosz tried to instill a vision for the potential of a wide-open, collaborative student space. Cramb liked the idea and they began looking for a home for the Idea Shop. In February, when Wexford, the real estate developer of University Technology Park, approached them about an affordable available space in the lower level of UTP's Technology Business Center that could be converted quickly, they jumped.\"In March, this space was nothing. It was an unfinished basement,\" Gosz remembers. Now, he believes the Idea Shop is well on its way to serving a purpose similar to that of the Fab Lab (short for fabrication laboratory) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students collaborate to develop and refine new ideas.\"This makes us distinctive and lets us show that this university is a home for entrepreneurs and innovators, a place that will cater to their needs,\" says Cramb. \"We are showing with the Idea Shop that we are very serious about these values, and that this is a major focus for us, not just with words but with resources.\"The next step is to tweak the university's courses to accommodate the dynamic learning the Idea Shop will facilitate. One way the Idea Shop will help to serve that goal is through a counterintuitive concept in higher education\u2014larger classes. While an IPRO team typically has no more than a dozen members, two prototype IPRO sections this fall each will have 50 students. That will invite the broader perspectives of more students from different backgrounds and programs, and also accommodate a multidisciplinary teaching team as well as guest speakers. From there, the sections will split into the small teams that will work together on IPRO projects. That's where the stations\u2014the projectors sprinkled throughout the Idea Shop, with every square inch of wall space a functional white board\u2014come into play. As the students head off to work in teams, each team will be able to access the features of a high-tech corporate conference room, not to mention the prototyping equipment.The Idea Shop's impact will extend beyond IPRO, Jacobius predicts. Although IPRO teams likely will serve as the Idea Shop's anchor tenants, IIT's Entrepreneurship Academy and other entrepreneurial activities will be housed in the shop. This summer, the space was used for the Exelon Summer Institute for first-year IIT students and a math camp for high school students.\"Our faculty and students will be inspired by this space,\" Jacobius says. \"This is going to be a resource that's a little different than what you'll find in the other labs on campus, which are also unique but maybe not as open as we envision this will be. And because of that, I think this will stimulate a lot of collaboration across the different colleges at IIT.\"The Idea Shop already is distinguishing IIT's identity, and the university anticipates that there soon will be a more tangible, visible symbol of IIT's commitment to creativity. The university is planning to rename the street in front of UTP, so that the road to the Idea Shop will be aptly known as \"Innovation Alley.\"This fall, the IPRO program will begin to prototype a new IPRO 2.0 format\u2014funded by a $50,000 Innovation Generation University grant from the Motorola Foundation. This will include new components focused on providing students with skills and experiences that will facilitate design thinking and innovation, as well as aligning students with projects that excite them, and allowing students to work on the same team and project for at least two semesters instead of one. IPRO 2.0 will also encourage more cross-disciplinary collaboration. (Currently, some IPRO teams are over-weighted with members from high-enrollment majors, but the IPRO ideal is a team in which each member plays a specific role based on knowledge and experience unique to his or her primary area of study.)The long-term, team-based projects will better prepare students for life after college, according to John Stoner, an intellectual property lawyer who teaches IPRO courses as an adjunct faculty member. \"This type of experience will facilitate the students' transition from an academic environment to a professional one, where this mode of collaborative, multidisciplinary work is very common,\" he says."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/alumni-awards", "content": "Alan \"Bud\" Wendorf (ME '71)Vasudevan \"Raj\" Rajaram (LAW '91)Ronald Hochsprung (CS '72)Jules KnappAkihisa \"Aki\" Miwa (M.S.

He and Andrea Berry (CS '82), who is now chair of the Alumni Association Board of Directors and a member of the Board of Trustees, co-founded the organization in 2011 following a successful event they planned together to honor Nate Thomas, whose work helped to set the bar for STEM education at Illinois Tech. They became reengaged with the university through the Alumni Association, and 4A was born.The group's mission is to mentor the current generation of Illinois Tech students and to ensure that future generations have the same opportunities that they received. For its annual meeting in 2015, the group held a fundraiser called the Scarlet Affair in conjunction with Global Spirit Day. Members wanted to raise money to establish a scholarship in Thomas's name, and they needed $25,000 to do it.\"Going into it, I told myself I would be ecstatic if we raised $5,000. By the end of the night, we had $17,000 (in cash and pledges),\" says Hill, adding that he was shocked and humbled by the generosity and commitment of his fellow alumni. To keep 4A on the right track, Hill is always looking to the future.\"We hope to finish funding this scholarship; our next step is to make an endowment,\" he says, which will fund the scholarship in perpetuity. \"I know it's a big goal, but we blew the first one out of the water, and I know that collectively, these people always come through. I think we can do it.\"Hill's advice to alumni hoping to start an affinity group? Just do it!\"It all starts with an idea. Get your group together, even if it's just four of you, and work from there,\" he says. \"You need to have the desire to do it and the dedication to follow through more than anything.

K. Rowling, author of the popular Harry Potter series of novels. Incorporating elements of soccer and tag football, the game consists of two teams of seven players whose goal is to score points by throwing balls through hoops and catching a player called the \"Golden Snitch.\" Zasadzinski, who plays offense, says that endurance, the ability to run quickly and continuously, and the desire to participate in an adrenalin-fueled coed sport are qualities that make for the best quidditch players.\"A lot of people might think that it's a really nerdy sport and that the only way they would like it is if they know exactly what is going on in the books,\" says Zasadzinski, founder and president of Illinois Tech's premiere quidditch club team, QuiddIITch. \"But I would say that a good majority join for the athletic aspect.\"Formed in 2015 the team has participated in two local tournaments taking second in each. With a five-person executive board now in place, Zasadzinski says that the goal is to increase the number of regular players from nine to 15 for 2016\u201317, her final year at the university.

She has created a career landscape spanning more than 40 years as an artist, arts administrator, jewelry designer, collector, and appraiser.Specializing in works created by African-American artists, Rabb started the consultancy in 1992, inspired to advocate for African-American, mid-career artists by connecting them with patrons desiring pieces for their homes and corporate offices.Her client base speaks to her influence in the art world. After curating an art collection for the John Hancock Center offices of Quintin E. Primo III, co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Capri Capital Partners, Rabb collaborated with him and his wife, Diane, to build an important African-American art collection in their home. Whether acquiring art for a private collection or choosing pieces that ensure a sense of comfort for racially diverse visitors entering John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Rabb strives to find the perfect piece for each client. Selecting art begins with accessing an immense mental inventory of art, artists, dealers, and gallery owners.\"There's a lot in my head,\" says Rabb, raising her hands to her temples. The musical jangle of the silver bracelets she designed accentuates the motion. \"Choosing the right art can be like a treasure hunt for me.\"That hunt ideally involves early collaboration with not only her client but also designers and architects to ensure the space complements the artwork.Rabb's own space, a bold but elegant home and office overlooking Lake Michigan, is adorned with her extensive art collection, including the work of Kerry James Marshall and Lorna Simpson, the paintings of her great-aunt and portrait artist Laura Wheeler Waring, and Rabb's early paintings and prints.After graduating from the Maryland Institute College of Art and marrying her husband (the late) Maurice Rabb, she moved to Chicago in 1966. While raising two young sons, Rabb enrolled in Illinois Tech's design program to pursue her interest in printmaking. She worked as a studio artist until the early 1980s, when she began to feel especially isolated in her career and desired a change.\"As an African-American woman artist married to a successful physician, I struggled to be taken seriously. I was creating art that reflected stories of my upper-middle class life, and to some, I was perceived as a dilettante. I felt like a misfit among the more revolutionary Black Power movement artists and the white feminist artists,\" Rabb explains, regarding her decision to transition into arts administration. \"I wanted a different challenge.\"She became involved in the late Harold Washington's mayoral campaign and the Artists for Washington Committee. When Washington was elected, he appointed Rabb as executive director of the former Chicago Office of Fine Arts. The eight-year position led to one of the most ambitious projects of her career, that of guiding a committee in choosing artwork for the Harold Washington Library Center.Rabb has recently added art appraisal to her perpetual work-in-progress career. Yet, purchasing art for clients still comprises most of her time, and that expertise comes with the following advice:\"Buy art with your heart and your head,\" says Rabb.For this artist, it is also the way you create a life's work."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/chicago-chunk-by-chunk", "content": "Rocco Buttliere (ARCH 4th year) is on his way to becoming an architect, but what he is right now is a creative and masterful bricklayer who started his training at age 6. Buttliere's bricks are not made of clay and shale but rather, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or polycarbonate\u2014the two plastic components behind the most commonly fabricated LEGO bricks and plates.For the past seven years, Buttliere, from Buffalo Grove, Illinois, has been paying homage to Chicago by recreating chunks of the city in LEGO, Lilliputian-style, at a scale of 1:650. Last December he flew to London to participate in BRICK 2015, a five -day expo of all things LEGO. Buttliere raised the money for his freight costs for his 43 buildings, including the Chicago-scape and international models such as the Houses of Parliament (London), the Oriental Pearl Radio & TV Tower (Shanghai, China), and the Chrysler Building (New York), through Kickstarter.The public was able to view Buttliere's miniaturized versions of Marina City, Tribune Tower, and many buildings comprising the city's skyline in the lobby of AMA Plaza in Chicago's North Loop neighborhood (also done in LEGO) this past February. Buttliere also participates in Chicago's yearly Brickworld convention in June and will have all his models on display at Illinois Tech's Block City event slated for July 23 on Mies Campus.I remember being interested in LEGO ever since the first grade. I started with Harry Potter sets and then moved on to Star Wars; it was always aligned with whatever I was interested in at the time. LEGO started as a hobby first and foremost, but at this point it's become an artistic medium for me to express something from real life. It's a passion.I use Google Earth a lot. It's a really good tool because it has 3-D models of the buildings so I can look at all of the details and real-world dimensions, and make measurements. When I'm designing the buildings I switch back and forth between that and the LEGO digital-design software. I order pieces of LEGO from BrickLink [the world's largest online marketplace for new and used LEGO pieces]. It's pretty costly though, because there's never one seller who has everything that you want, so you wind up making 10 or more orders for just one model.The models I have, on average, range between 3,000\u20134,000 pieces; the largest one is 22,500 pieces. A general rule for LEGO is that every 1,000 pieces costs around $100. But it really does depend on what kinds of pieces you're using.It's hard for me to pick a favorite because there are parts in each one that I think work really well. One building can't hold all of the cool stuff! If I had to pick as close to favorite as I could, I'd choose the Parliament model. The thing I love about designing early skyscrapers and landmarks is that you really get to use some unique and often oddly shaped pieces to express just the right amount of detail. The Houses of Parliament is, without a doubt, the first example of neo-Gothic architecture and has informed many subsequent American skyscraper designs of the early twentieth century. Having already done some of these skyscrapers, it was a challenge to work backwards in a way, utilizing a wealth of techniques I had theretofore developed, as well as many that are unique to this particular model. There's also the challenge of capturing the expansive horizontal presence of such a building, while at the same time accommodating the trademark verticality of the neo-Gothic style.I think time will tell how expansive I end up making this project.\u00a0 I've considered several practical borders for the model, but obviously nothing is set in stone (or plastic, rather) until I actually design and build up to these borders. But I would say that up to the 900 or 1000 North block of Michigan Avenue is ideal for the north border; enough of the lake to fill out all of Navy Pier to the east; Roosevelt Road to the south, though probably with a further extension for the Museum Campus and Soldier Field; and likely a shifting border to the west, up to the highway in the West Loop area.Currently, the layout is anchored by several of the taller skyscrapers throughout the city. The largest chunk so far is obviously my North Loop layout, comprising everything from Marina City and Trump Tower to Randolph Street at the north end of Millennium Park. My plan is to work on expanding a few other areas before I start bringing more into this layout. By the time Block City in July comes around, I should have a sizable chunk of North Michigan Avenue and the Water Tower area added to my current John Hancock + Water Tower Place layout.One of the challenges of creating this urban landscape with the level of accuracy that I tend to strive for is integrating buildings that are not situated directly on the Chicago street grid. My Trump Tower model is perhaps the best example of how I've tackled this issue. Because of the bend in the Chicago River, the base for that whole model is rotated to reflect this shifting condition. Since Trump Tower was one of the first Chicago models I made, I've ended up completely redesigning the base three times as I started to fill in the surrounding buildings. Most people get overwhelmed when I describe this willingness to knock it down and redo it, but I think that's part of the design process. One thing that studio has taught me is that if something isn't working, you\u00a0 have to find a way to make it work with the set of rules you've established for yourself. Most of the time, that requires the resolve to first, admit this, and second, to act on it.I've actually helped Adam on a number of projects since 2011; for a while, I guess you could say I was his apprentice. The first project I helped him out on was a 10-foot model of the Burj Khalifa that was actually sent to Dubai for permanent display. I've also helped him out on a couple of Willis Tower models, one of which is on display at the Water Tower Place LEGO Store, and most recently, a sprawling model of Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesen West, which is now on permanent display at the actual building. I would say that my time working with Adam was truly my first exposure to learning under someone with an architectural education. He taught me a lot as far as architectural expression through an artistic medium is concerned.\u00a0 Though my years of studio and architecture studies have more heavily informed what I do with LEGO now, my years working with Adam provided the foundation, so to speak."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/classnotes", "content": "(ARCH '42, M.S.

They lobbied to expand the product's diagnostic scope to address these aspects, but the executive leadership wasn't interested. The duo left in 2005 and began Wi-Tronix in Jordan's basement. Joined by two former co-workers, the team began to develop their Wi\u2011PU\u2122 [Wireless Processing Unit] and remote monitoring system solution. Recognizing that their innovative Internet of Things (IoT) technology was not limited to the rail industry, they coined the term \"high-value mobile asset\" to encompass expensive (costing more than $1 million) equipment that can be piloted away (from locomotives to tugboats), has a long life cycle, and demands sophisticated monitoring.About the size of a square tissue box, the Wi-PU can connect to a locomotive's event recorder, or \"black box,\" and continuously monitors conditions and triggers remote alerts for inefficient or unsafe operations and accidents. In the United States, the recorder monitors and records data such as train speed, direction of motion, and brake applications and operations. The Wi-PU gathers data remotely in real time and provides the railway with information on fuel monitoring, GPS location, and access to on-board data. The unit is updatable, compatible with any mobile asset's black box, and adaptable to future changes in technology.\"We wanted the device to stand out from the blue of companies like General Motors and General Electric and from the blacks and grays of other locomotive electronics\" -Mike HeilmannWhile the rail industry has been the company's mainstay, with a client list that includes Amtrak, BNSF Railway, CN, and Kansas City Southern, the Wi-PU has been fitted onto water vessels such as the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ferries and Illinois Marine Towing boats in suburban Lemont. When Jordan and Heilmann approached the marine industry, they discovered no consolidated method existed for remote monitoring of high-value assets, such as tugboats. Heilmann says the marine paradigm mirrors that of the railway's, \"a longtime industry in which technology implementation is still a very new concept.\"Wi-Tronix now monitors more than 10,000 high-value mobile assets. In 2015 Jordan and Heilmann received the Daily Herald Business Ledger Entrepreneurial Excellence Award in the Innovation category for their idea.While the Wi-Tronix team has grown to more than 90 employees and is now headquartered in a sleek office space in Bolingbrook, Illinois, the duo hasn't forgotten how Illinois Tech helped to shape the company's foundation. Heilmann, executive vice president of business development, explains that he drew on the knowledge he gained in a brand management course at Illinois Tech as the team decided on the company's colors and logo.\"We wanted the device to stand out from the blue of companies like General Motors and General Electric and from the blacks and grays of other locomotive electronics,\" says Heilmann about the team's decision to use purple as Wi-PU's central color.\"Through the fresh opportunities IIT afforded and with the help of professors, I was able to invent,\" recalls Jordan, noting that Wi-Tronix offers Illinois Tech students and alumni internship and employment opportunities.The expanded Wi-Tronix team, including Ken Schleich (AE '11), recently unveiled its latest visionary product. At its annual conference this May, Wi-Tronix officially announced the launch of Violet\u2122, the new, industry-leading, multi-functional Locomotive Data Acquisition Recording System (LDARS).Violet makes other LDARS systems obsolete by enabling a host of new functionalities, including predictive diagnostics to increase locomotive reliability and video analytics that will improve safety for crews, railway workers, and the public.Wi-Tronix:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/class-2016", "content": "Cleversafe founder and Illinois Institute of Technology Trustee Chris Gladwin delivered the 2016 Commencement keynote address, during which he asked the Class of 2016 to pose for a photo [above].

In 2016 Jischke established the IIT Board of Trustees Undergraduate Teaching Award as a token of gratitude. He and his wife, Patty, were inspired to create the award for three reasons: to say thank you for his own excellent undergraduate experience, to encourage a continued emphasis in excellent undergraduate teaching, and to show the Illinois Tech community the importance that the Board of Trustees attaches to the excellence of its programs.\"It takes a lot of time and energy to be an excellent teacher, and Patty and I hope that this award will serve as inspiration and encouragement to make that commitment.\" - Martin Jischke\"I've spent my career in higher education, and one enduring lesson I've learned is that all faculty members hope to become excellent teachers.

Weary of her existence, she entered into an outreach program in 2012 offered by Heartland Alliance Outreach on Chicago's North Side. By making the decision to save her own life, Ballentine would go on to help rescue countless other individuals through her involvement with Corrigan and his Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project.\"The research suggests that people with serious mental illness get sick and die about 10\u201315 years earlier than everybody else; when you add to that being of color, low-income status, or homelessness, the number goes through the roof\" -Patrick Corrigan\"At the time I met Pat, I had just moved into permanent housing through Heartland,\" recalls Ballentine, her commanding and spirited voice not unlike those of the preachers in the churches of the South Side neighborhood where she grew up. \"I went to Heartland's resource center because I was experiencing a bad bout of depression\u2014I felt isolated and alone in my apartment as it was totally different for me coming from shelter group settings\u2014and noticed an application to participate in a consumer research team at Illinois Tech. I thought it would simply be an opportunity to make a few bucks and get out of the house.\"Corrigan hired Ballentine to be one of eight individuals comprising a CBPR team\u2014community members with \"lived experience\"\u2014who developed a program for peer navigators to assist others with serious mental illness who were homeless.\"The research suggests that people with serious mental illness get sick and die about 10\u201315 years earlier than everybody else; when you add to that being of color, low-income status, or homelessness, the number goes through the roof,\" says Corrigan, a recognized CBPR practitioner and director of the National Consortium on Stigma and Empowerment.Ballentine's first project with Corrigan was so successful that in 2015 he obtained a two-year $250,000 grant from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), created as part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, to develop a curriculum, manual, and workbook to teach Chicago-area community-service providers how to establish their own CBPR programs. This year Corrigan's team, including Ballentine, whom he retained as a research associate, selected two providers\u2014Heartland Alliance and Emmaus Ministries\u2014as participants in the new program, Inspiring Change.\"Emmaus is the only organization that is dedicated full time to reaching out to men in survival sex in Chicago. I would estimate we serve 150\u2013300 African-American men with mental illness every year.\u00a0For the men we have worked with over the past year, more than 72 percent deal with at least one serious mental health illness; the majority of the men we serve are also African American,\" says Libby Trudeau, client services analyst. \"Inspiring Change intrigued us because a CBPR model includes the opinions and input of the men. Our project involves a survey about how these men get physical health care. We will be exploring what barriers and needs this population might face.\"Emmaus, and Heartland, which is designing a self-management wellness program, have each been awarded up to $21,000 to complete their projects by December 31. Through a second, multi-million dollar grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, Corrigan and Ballentine will examine how African Americans with serious mental illness control weight gain through diet and exercise when they live in food and activity deserts.

IITRI scientists\u2014the first to model today's new strain\u2014are now testing viable treatments and vaccines.In 1947 defibrillation was first performed on a human, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to scientists who discovered how glycogen breaks down in the human body, and the United States Army successfully launched and returned the first living animal\u2014fruit flies\u2014to and from outer space.A lot has changed since then\u2014including the Zika virus.\"Scientists have started to sequence older samples of Zika from 1947, when Zika was first discovered in Africa, but the current virus is likely different,\" says Robert Baker, manager of the Microbiology and Molecular Biology Division at IIT Research Institute, Illinois Tech's contract research organization.IITRI leveraged its experience in modeling similar viruses including West Nile and dengue fever to become the first laboratory in the U.S. to receive human samples of the current Zika strain. In May IITRI completed its pre-clinical model of the virus and as of press date has begun testing the efficacy of existing drugs and vaccines in reducing Zika's symptoms and rates of infection, respectively.\"We have gotten to the finish line before the others,\" says Baker, who is leading the study.According to Baker, within a few weeks of testing IITRI could feasibly send its research findings to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could issue an emergency use authorization granting an already-licensed drug to be prescribed for the additional purpose of alleviating Zika.\"Our model shows lethal effects with fewer than 10 virus particles. We could see deaths with as few as two to three Zika virus particles,\" says Baker, adding that in humans it typically takes more than 10,000 flu virus particles to make someone sick. \"This indicates our model is very sensitive at showing how pharmaceuticals can have an effect on Zika.\"IITRI's findings may extend well beyond identifying possible Zika medication and assist with the analysis of why, 64 years since the first cases of Zika in humans were documented, the virus is affecting the Brazilian population more severely than individuals in other parts of the world. Although the world's first large human outbreak occurred in Micronesia in 2007, and the second in several Pacific islands seven years later, it wasn't until February of this year that the World Health Organization declared Zika a public health emergency of international concern due to its association with microcephaly and other neurological disorders in Brazil.\"Brazil is an area with previous dengue infection,\" notes Baker. \"Our work may help to show for the first time that infection and recovery from one virus could lead to worse affects from a later infection by a separate virus.\"Robert Baker, a microbiologist at IITRI, says that Zika thus far is confirmed to spread in one of two ways: 1) An uninfected local mosquito bites a human infected with Zika elsewhere and then passes the virus to its offspring (vertical transmission), who later pass it to humans, or 2) Mosquitos (both infected and uninfected) pass it from person to person by biting multiple people. \"Zika is transmitted by two species of Asian tiger mosquitos. Asian tiger mosquitos, whose peak biting periods are early morning and before dusk in the evening, thrive in urban environments and cover 50 percent of the United States,\" says Baker. \"They are promiscuous biters\u2014flying hypodermic needles.\" This image [above] is a digitally colorized transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Zika virus, with virus particles colored red (source: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith).Zika Virus:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2016/juris-cannabis", "content": "In his three-piece suit, Joseph Wright (LAW '13) resembles a young James Bond, a man of international daring and intrigue.

Plus, patients are not allowed to grow their own pot. Certifying physicians must prove a prior and ongoing medical relationship with the patient. Licensed growers must comply with zoning laws, maintain 24-hour surveillance, and ensure strict inventory control.Approximately 7,000 patients have enrolled in the program since its launch in November 2015, and up to 200 new applications arrive every week. Still, the fledgling program is not without its challenges. Some doctors refuse to sign patient identification cards, which certify that a person has a qualifying condition, because they think it's the same as writing a prescription. Growers struggle with zoning and product quality issues\u2014there's no federal standard, for example, on how much pesticide is safe to allow in weed\u2014and the task of building an industry where none previously existed.Fortunately Wright, who recently restored a 1979 Yamaha XS 650 motorcycle, enjoys solving problems and building things.\"What enticed me about this job was the challenge to help create this program and put it on solid footing. It's a fantastic opportunity to build something that hopefully makes people's lives better,\" he says.Serving as director was a natural leap for Wright, who spent six months solving issues with the program's grower licenses while working as a lawyer in the Office of Governor Bruce Rauner.

At Illinois Tech, Meade may be best known for having led teams of students to Latin America, where they provided orthotic treatment to youngsters with scoliosis, or lateral curvature of the spine, through the university's Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program. Since his stroke, some of Meade's former students have designed an IPRO course\u2014and an assistive therapeutic device\u2014to benefit their teacher whose life changed in the proverbial instant.\"I kind of joke about this whole situation,\" Meade continues in characteristic good spirits, seated in his wheelchair in his office in the John T. Rettaliata Engineering Center. \"Now I'm serving in the role of a patient\u2014so I've got it all covered.\"Meade's former student Sady Wootten (ME '15) says that when she learned of Meade's stroke and saw the difficulties he was having on his right side both sitting and standing, she wanted to help. Inspired by Mobilus\u2014a standing wheelchair her father had begun to design for a friend with multiple sclerosis\u2014she approached Meade about developing an IPRO that would tailor the wheelchair for his specific needs. Meade was flattered but insisted that the project be applicable to as many people as possible with similar disabilities. They agreed to start the process with Wootten doing an independent study course on biomechanics with him.\"A mechanical engineer learns how parts move, how forces act on bodies; but it's a really interesting twist to start to see how forces act onbodies,\" recalls Wootten, now a junior quality engineer at L&T Technology Services, about her greatest take-away from that course.Nearly 25 students enrolled in the first IPRO in spring 2015. She divided the class into three groups: one worked on altering Mobilus, which Wootten's father donated to the project; the second group interviewed and videotaped Meade to determine his needs; and the third group began designing an arm therapy device\u2014The Supinator\u2014to encourage both pronation (turning the hand/arm so that the palm faces down) and supination (turning the hand/arm so that the palm faces up), both which are limited on Meade's affected side. The Supinator proved to be so beneficial that it became the new focal point of two subsequent IPRO courses (fall 2015 and spring 2016).\"For me, personally, it works,\" says Meade about the device, which he has been using for 15-minute sessions, twice per week. Composed of a motorcycle chain, heavy-duty gears, and SiliGrips comfort handles, The Supinator is encased in an easily transportable stainless steel and acrylic tabletop box. [Watch theof Meade demonstrating The Supinator.] The student team has also been working on a similar apparatus to assist in knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion in Meade's lower limb.While the IPRO is not currently slated to continue in the fall, The Supinator itself has a promising future. One of Meade's physicians at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital is looking to enlist The Supinator in a clinical trial comparing it to the costly ArmeoSpring therapeutic device now used in stroke recovery. Meade's colleague in Colombia, Jose Miguel Gomez, M.D., of Gomez Orthotic Systems, has agreed to pilot a Supinator according to the IPRO team's specifications. And a group of Stuart School of Business students has drafted a business model to help the IPRO team bring The Supinator to a wider number of patients. [See below.]\"We're looking into doing an open-source model of The Supinator, which would allow for an even more affordable device, as this model comes in at about $200,\" says Tyler Grudowski (ME 4th year), current IPRO project manager. \"With the open-source model, made of PVC pipe and wood, the cost will drop down to about $50.\"For Grudowski, who lost several family members to heart disease and cancer, this IPRO experience was a high point of his education.\"As a student one of my overarching goals was to develop something in the medical field that would truly have the potential to make a difference and positive impact in someone's life,\" he says. \"So when Sady told me about this project I thought, this is it. The goal of this IPRO is to reach out and help not only Dr. Meade but as many people as possible. That's why I love this IPRO so much.\"Clinical Associate Professor of Innovation Christine Miller says that normally her capstone 480 course for undergraduates explores venture development at the \"ideas-on-a-napkin\" stage. When she learned about the Mobilus IPRO course, she thought it would be a perfect real-world opportunity for her students to make an important\u2014and tangible\u2014contribution.\"Experiential learning is key for students,\" says Miller, who has been on the faculty at Stuart School of Business for the past two years.About 24 students, half of her class, signed up to craft business models for the Mobilus IPRO team. Zach Pergrossi (BA 4th year) echoes Miller's sentiment about having the chance to gain knowledge by working on a project outside the box\u2014and the textbook.\"I saw it as a chance to do something concrete,\" he explains. \"I had first seen the Mobilus project at an IPRO Day. So it was a really great opportunity to have such a diverse group of students in business and engineering get together to produce results that were practical, not just theoretical.\"To help ensure that the IPRO team's Supinator device can benefit as many people as possible, Pergrossi says that his group provided the team with research that informed the design of four distinct business models. They recommended that the IPRO team pursue licensing the device and provided information about competitors and industry conditions.

When Bilson was an economics graduate student at, a visiting professor from the University of Chicago suggested that he enter that institution's Ph.D. program in international economics. Bilson took his advice and while listening to a lecture at Chicago by\u2014who would go on to share in the 2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences\u2014he experienced a shift in direction.\"Fama suggested that we students really learn about finance,\" Bilson recalls, noting that both exchange rates and the stock market were undergoing a chaotic period at that time. \"A little flashlight went off in my head that maybe it would be a good idea for me to write my dissertation on applying finance to exchange rates.\"That small beam turned into a spotlight as Bilson would go on to teach topics in exchange rates on the faculties of Chicago, Northwestern University, Stanford Graduate School of Business, and the Stanford University Hoover Institution. In 1987 he began working for the late John A. \"Jack\" Wing, chief executive officer of the investment banking and brokerage firm The Chicago Corporation and Illinois Tech trustee, who believed that after the Stock Market Crash of 1987 a new breed of finance student was in order. Wing recruited Bilson and other Chicago-area finance experts into an informal think-tank to design a graduate-level finance program built on a technical foundation.Thus began Stuart's Center for Financial Markets (now the) with Wing as its first director. From 1995\u201399 Bilson directed the center's Financial Markets and Trading Program and since 2005 has directed its latest iteration, the M.S. in finance and the master's in mathematical finance programs. Looking out the north-facing windows of his office on the 18th floor of IIT Tower, Bilson gestures toward Chicago's Loop as he discusses collaborative plans underway at the business school.\"Chicago has been an innovative city for finance going all the way back to the 1880s, when we started creating the futures markets as a way of helping farmers decide what to produce, and know today what price they could get at the end of the season,\" says Bilson. \"So, basically, what we're doing is trying to take that history of the city and converting it into an academic program.\"One way Bilson is doing so is by envisioning Stuart's Downtown Campus as a hub of entrepreneurship and innovation that will offer students academic collaborative opportunities in design, business, and law.\"This will give us a unique character in a crowded business school market,\" he says. \"No other business school in the city has a design school. Design is taught in a collaborative framework and business is technical. This is the time in which we can create a new kind of business school that fits in with the technological nature of what is happening in the community.\"Joint finance program offerings on the Mies Campus are already in the process of expansion. In addition to the new mathematical finance degree program that Bilson heads, other degree programs being considered are algorithmic finance, electricity markets, and financial regulation compliance. Members of the Stuart community have been involved in entrepreneurial initiatives coordinated byand are looking to do more in the city's burgeoning(financial technology) scene and Chicago's, formed to encourage the hiring of women and minorities in financial services business. Stuart students are creatively enhancing both their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and the reputation of Stuart School by participation in finance showdowns such as the CFA Institute Research Challenge and the Chicago Quantitative Alliance Student Portfolio Contest. Bilson served as advisor to the quant team, which took first place in 2015 and 2016.While finding even more ways to increase the school's visibility can be challenging, Bilson believes that Stuart School has the distinct advantage when it comes to an issue affecting every business school.\"The world is developing so rapidly that it's incredibly difficult for universities to keep up,\" he says. \"But at Stuart we're a lot more flexible than some of the bigger schools, can change direction more easily because we're smaller, and can more readily introduce new concepts and products.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2016/alumnus-spotlight", "content": "Fine art artist/photographer whose 24'x56' mural \"Descending into Heaven\" can be viewed through January 2017 at 710 South Wabash in Chicago, courtesy of the Wabash Arts Corridor.There is boldness and richness in the colors and even in the pictures that are more black and white.

At this point in my life I look back and think that it's such a pleasure to have been able to achieve those childhood dreams.\"Seated in his office in IIT Tower under a mounted plush toy deer head topped by a plush toy walrus, his commuter bicycle leaning against a wall (he also travels across Mies Campus on a scooter), White speaks about his love of science in a voice that hasn't lost its youthful exuberance. He says that he likes teaching physics to aspiring scientists and engineers, and loves teaching physics to \"everybody else.\" Whether he is searching for a component of antimatter, brainstorming with his team on how to increase campus research productivity, or finding ways to get students as excited about physics as he is, White thrives on tackling challenges.\"Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that there isn't an easy way to quantify scholarly output. Even by the various disciplines, what qualifies as a publication differs; there isn't a single metric that the institution can apply,\" he says. \"That makes things kind of messy, but that's what I like\u2014I prefer to dive into the weeds. I really like the gray areas of life because that's where so much happens. Instead of saying how we define research, we're going to have to have a long conversation about it because you can't just pin it down that way.\"White and his two administrative colleagues,, Nambury S. Raju Professor of Psychology and deputy vice provost for research and academic affairs, and Jamshid Mohammadi, professor of civil and architectural engineering and associate dean of the Graduate College, have met for a preliminary discussion on how the university can reduce barriers to research productivity, such as ramping up targeted marketing efforts to attract more highly qualified Ph.D. students. The trio also plans to further consult with Sigma Xi senior faculty winners who comprise the Research Academy advisory group and work with Idea Shop Director Jeremy Alexis and faculty from the Institute of Design to determine if the offices under the research umbrella are structured in the best way to advance faculty output. White is confident that as he identifies and manages the weeds, his fellow academe members will find new ways to explore and expand their work.\"My job is not to come up with solutions; my job is to lead,\" he says. \"The solutions will come from the faculty themselves.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2016/its-alive-its-alive", "content": "The child takes scissors to the neck of the stuffed bear.

Louis Fernandez (ARCH '11), an architect now working in New York City, along with Michael Pecirno, a design strategist in London, served as long-distance collaborators. An avid cyclist, Fernandez helped design the bicycle-turned-mobile maker space.\"The FrankenToyMobile strengthens the sense that children have power to affect their world and challenge the narratives they are handed or surrounded by, all through the unassuming activity of breaking and recombining toys,\" says Fernandez.Other alumni and local high school students join in the Franken-fun, too.

Thehit Nepal on April 25, 2015, triggering the deadliest day in the history of Mt. Everest and killing nearly 9,000 people in Nepal.Besecker is no stranger to the world crumbling beneath his feet. Yet, he possesses a proclivity for gaining a foothold and overcoming obstacles.In 1992 Besecker enrolled at Illinois Tech's Stuart School of Business on a baseball scholarship, majored in marketing, and embraced leadership roles on campus. He was not, however, prepared for the diagnosis of a chronic heart issue in 2000 or the implant of a defibrillator three years later.Because of the unusual circumstances surrounding Besecker's age and medical conditions, his doctors suggested that he write a book. Besecker began filling the pages with his survivor's story all the while searching for a \"happy ending.\" That proved increasingly difficult with his brother's sudden death in 2004, his father's diagnosis of muscular dystrophy in 2005, and his mother's massive stroke and his own diagnosis of the muscle disease in 2006. Besecker continued to persevere, achieving goals that included running on the Great Wall of China and visiting all seven continents.In 2011 life-threatening health issues further besieged Besecker, including three cardiac ablation procedures, an emergency surgery to replace a faulty defibrillator, a major operation to remedy the failed ablations and address his severe atrial fibrillation, and a collapsed lung. While recovering in early 2012, he was invited to trek Everest Base Camp in 2013 with his sister Chris Griffin.\"The doctors thought I was crazy,\" Besecker says, \"and wouldn't consider giving me approval until I survived a year with no issues and began a rigorous training program.\"Besecker not only survived\u2014he achieved his goal of climbing Everest Base Camp in 2015.Besecker says he has the happy ending for his soon-to-be-published memoir, which he titled.\"'For' because I completed the expedition when I was 40, 'Ever' in memory of hiking Everest, and 'Strong' because I stayed strong throughout,\" he says. \"The happy ending is living my life.\"Today, Besecker is employed in hospice care at Advocate Health Care and spends much of his time as a real-life advocate for the.

Kluczynski Federal Building in Chicago's Loop, Robert Theel (ARCH '83) opens the Venetian blinds and points out a recognizable structure\u2014IIT Tower\u2014four miles south. It has served as both a physical and philosophic beacon in Theel's 34 years with the United States General Services Administration.\"I began working in this building the summer of my senior year in college and could see IITRI Tower, as we called it then, from my office, which was right about there,\" says Theel, pointing to the southeast corner of the room, currently used as a GSA collaboration space. \"Now I still work here and live halfway between this building and campus, so I feel that I'm moving ever closer to IIT.\"Theel, who designed his first buildings with LEGO bricks as a kid in his suburban-Milwaukee home and developed his architectural talents as a student in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's S. R. Crown Hall, is now the guardian of the Chicago Federal Center, which Mies also designed and where Theel has worked for his entire career with the GSA. As regional chief architect and director of the Design & Construction Division of the GSA's Great Lakes Region, Theel provides architectural and design oversight for 137 other federally owned properties totaling 20 million square feet across a six-state area. Over the course of his GSA career, he has guided more than $3 billion in design and construction projects that include five courthouses, five border stations, and eight federal buildings, and more than 30 major modernizations of existing federal facilities. Theel's design oversight also includes safeguarding the historic heritage and cultural character of 55 properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.Working with a GSA staff of 25 subject-matter experts in architecture, engineering, and design, Theel, much like a typical homeowner, decides if an aging building can be improved simply with a new roof, insulated windows, a fresh coat of paint\u2014or if it requires a more radical transformation. In the case of Cleveland's Anthony J. Celebrezze Federal Building, that came in the form of a second-skin glass curtainwall cocoon constructed to protect the original 1966 fa\u00e7ade and make the building more energy efficient and secure. The architectural firm Theel selected to design the double-glass wall concept\u2014the first constructed on an existing high-rise\u2014was Interactive Design Architects (the firm recently selected to partner on the design of the Obama Presidential Center) with Charles Young (ARCH '79) as project architect.\"The double-wall development permitted what is essentially a thermos bottle effect insulating the existing building from the elements; light shades and glass coatings were added to boost performance yet maintain a simple system that would not require complex operations,\" Young explains about the federal building, which was completed last year.\u00a0\"The building is orientated 35 degrees off the N-S axis so that two fa\u00e7ades were designed with a shading methodology that addressed direct sunlight.\u00a0The other two fa\u00e7ades receive oblique light during the workday so that alternate shading types were utilized on those fa\u00e7ades.\u00a0In this way the building reacts to the changes of light and protects the occupants and systems from excess environmental loads. A further benefit of the double-wall approach was that the work could essentially be done to the outside of a fully occupied building with minimal interference to the internal tenants,\" which, according to Theel, was the single most cost-effective element of the design contributing to project success.Another of Theel's noteworthy projects is the multi-phase renovation of the Everett McKinley Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, also part of the Mies-designed Chicago Federal Center. Theel served as project manager on the building's restructuring and renovations on which he collaborated with several Chicago architects, including Dirk Lohan; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; and Munin Choudrey (M.S. ARCH '66) to provide space for up to 23 more two-story federal district courtrooms within the building. The most recent phase of the award-winning $158 million renovation was completed in late 2012. Theel recalls one of his first GSA projects right out of Illinois Tech was also in the Dirksen Courthouse, drafting detailed drawings of courtrooms for a smaller expansion that he oversaw in the 1980s. He says that in the act of designing that project, he knew then that his years on the campus that Mies built was the perfect complement to his job with the GSA.\"Not only did my education teach me discipline, but also appreciation for the subtlety, materiality, and proportions of Mies' progressive style of architecture,\" Theel explains. While his role as caretaker of federal buildings matters greatly to him, he never forgets the reason these buildings exist.\"Many of these buildings are symbols of our country; this federal complex we are in has historic status now,\" he says. \"It's important for us to maintain, update, and keep viable these buildings not only as symbols, but also so they can continue to serve the American public for years to come.\"Great Lakes Region GSA: www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104773\"Beautiful Historic Courthouse Receives Green Renovation\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2016/class-notes", "content": "(CHEM '50), Bonita Springs, Fla., is the founding director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The data storage startup grows from three employees to 35 by 2008, when it moves to downtown Chicago. With staff members including Illinois Tech computer science alumni, Cleversafe is sold to IBM for $1.3 billion in late 2015.: The second tenant, AllCell Technologies, a company based on Illinois Tech intellectual property for thermal management of lithium-ion batteries used in transportation, moves into newly constructed Incubator North. In 2011 AllCell expands and moves to its own manufacturing facility on Chicago's South Side.: UTP has its grand opening on November 29, made possible in large part through a partnership with private developer Wexford Science & Technology. Wexford purchases the former Chemistry Research Building and transforms it into a state-of-the-art, build-to-suit facility for life sciences companies and university research centers.: Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering relocates to UTP, moving into the Technology Business Center (TBC) and the Incubator.: Therapeutic Proteins International, a two-person startup commercializing new technology for the production of biosimilar pharmaceuticals, moves into the TBC. By 2016 the company grows to 160 employees and expects final United States Food and Drug Administration approval by early 2017.: Illinois Tech's Idea Shop opens in the TBC. With 13,000 square feet of creative space and a growing rapid-prototyping lab, it becomes the home of the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program and enrichment initiatives such as the Illinois Tech Global Leaders Program.: Incubator South is completed and features 15 wet labs, nine dry labs, and six offices. This building is made possible through an additional $2 million in funding from the State of Illinois and $4 million in U.S. Economic Development Administration stimulus grants.: More startups come to UTP, including Advanced Cooling Therapies, which has developed a system for rapid body cooling for stroke and heart attack victims, and SiNode Systems, a developer of a new material for improving the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries.: Baker steps down as UTP's executive director and is succeeded by Catherine Vorwald, former marketing and business development director for Wexford Science & Technology.\"The future of UTP is bright with the growing tenant base commercializing inventions from Illinois Tech,\" says Vorwald. \"The tech park is becoming an effective link for the transfer of technology from Illinois Tech for public use and benefit.\"\"Our dream has been for Illinois Tech to have an 'innovation alley' that starts with the new Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship at the center of Mies Campus and ends with UTP,\" says Baker. \"Student and faculty companies can continually be born and nurtured on campus because Illinois Tech is not only a place for learning, but also a place for creating.\"UTP:\"Chicago's Other Tech Incubator Is Here\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2016/greener-acres", "content": "\"These are the best tomatoes I've had since home,\" says Merjem Mededovic (BME 3rd year), reaching for a cluster of tiny crimson spheres dangling from a blossom-studded tomato plant in UFarmIIT. Growing up in urban Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, she looked forward to weekends when she could work in her grandfather's garden on the outskirts of the city. \"As a biomedical engineering student, I appreciate the importance of being active and eating right, and also helping Earth. Farming touches so many points that are part of a sustainable life.\"For the past six years, Illinois Tech students have worked a 5,000-square-foot space comprising UFarmIIT, an urban farm located in The Quad on Mies Campus. UFarmIIT began as a project of a landscape architecture elective in 2012, led by Rodger Cooley, an adjunct assistant professor of architecture in the landscape architecture program who also works in urban food system planning and policy. The project grew into a collaboration with both the student group Engineers for a Sustainable World and a first-year architecture studio course, in which students designed and installed the multipurpose fence. In 2013 UFarmIIT became an Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course, with spinoffs including an aquaponics research project on campus. Today UFarmIIT is an official student group, and the farm itself has evolved to become a test bed for sustainable urban farming with a tech edge.Beginning last year, Illinois Tech's Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research (WISER) began to invest in the technology infrastructure of UFarmIIT, aiding students in acquiring solar panels and controllers that have enabled the farm to operate completely off the grid.\"The goal is to provide a valuable, practical experience for Illinois Tech students,\" says Hamid Arastoopour, director of WISER. \"The challenge is to develop a completely automated, remotely controlled farm that uses renewable energy, creates no waste, minimizes water consumption, and provides safe and reliable food products. In doing so, the farm will serve as an economically feasible carbon-removal process for urban areas.\"Two separate pipes carrying water and wiring are buried in trenches spanning the length of the beds.Every third bed has a control panel with sensors that are connected to a central box in the shed and operated remotely.Water travels via hoses from a water pump with a gauge that receives messages from the control panel about the moisture level of the soil.UFarmIIT students designed and built the shed, which houses a Raspberry Pi-based controller that communicates with the sensors and control panels, and turns water on and off. Students involved in the Center for Smart Grid Applications and Research (CSMART) coded the controller. \"How much pressure do we need to take the water from the pump to the beds? What are the fluid dynamics involved? Students solved all of those problems,\" says Mededovic, outgoing president of UFarmIIT.WISER coordinated installation of the solar panels, which collect enough energy to power the entire farm: the controller and other mechanics, plus an outlet for students to play music. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #134 donated a charge controller, four 250W Sharp solar modules, other electrical equipment, and all labor required to complete the solar system installation. \"We used to have to plug into nearby buildings, but now we're completely independent,\" Mededovic says.UFarmIIT works with Sodexo and the on-campus coffee shop Global Grounds to collect compostable food items and coffee grounds, respectively. The food items are used in worm (vermi-compost) beds, and the coffee grounds are used to grow mushrooms indoors in the Facilities Building.Some UFarmIIT participants sell their produce on campus, and any remaining harvest is donated to the nearby St. James Food Pantry or offered to faculty and staff on a first-come, first-picked basis.Students have reported harvesting produce from the unheated hoop house as late as January.First-year architecture students designed and built the farm wall, which includes features that are at once decorative and functional, such as pockets for growing herbs.A new team of Illinois Tech faculty from WISER, the Institute for Food Safety and Health, Armour College of Engineering, the College of Architecture, College of Science, and Stuart School of Business has developed large proposals to conduct research that includes both expansion of the current UFarmIIT and creation of indoor vertical farming at Illinois Tech.Hamid Arastoopour says Illinois Tech plans to develop rigorous outreach activities to educate people from surrounding and outlying neighborhoods about urban farming and the potential to produce food sufficient to meet the needs of the people, and, in turn, bring jobs, economic growth, and safety to the community."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/research-overdrive", "content": "Last December when Illinois Tech learned that Jeff Wereszczynski, assistant professor of physics, was the recipient of a Faculty Early Career Development () Award from the National Science Foundation, the news was exciting enough.

For nearly five decades he has designed fire protection plans for structures such asin Saudi Arabia, Chicago's Willis Tower, and the Miami International Airport.Pennel says that while fire protection engineers know in most cases what causes the ignition of fires, predicting when fires are going to occur is one of the most difficult aspects of the job. Additionally, engineers can predict how a fire will grow in a single room but still cannot forecast how a fire will spread throughout a building. In order to test a fire protection system, engineers set up a configuration, install a sprinkler design, and test the system with a real fire. This testing module can be expensive, with large-scale fire testing ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.\"You have to be very careful in designing these configurations to make sure you get the answers you want and need,\" says Pennel, adding that high-rises present a special challenge. \"The fire department cannot use its normal equipment, so systems have to be built into the building itself.\"A lot besides how to tackle fires in tall buildings has changed in the field of fire protection since Pennel attended Illinois Tech. Although his major was discontinued in the early 1980s, the fire protection engineering program, which was established at Armour Institute in 1903, served as a model for others that followed across the country. According to archival documentation, the first woman in the United States to receive a degree in fire protection engineering graduated from Illinois Tech.\"Fire protection engineering has gone from being somewhat of an art to being more of a science,\" he says. \"Fire is a very dynamic entity, so it's hard to know exactly what's going to happen.\" Pennel went from using a TI SR-10 calculator, his workhorse tool that had the ability to do square roots, to relying on state-of-the-art computer programs to help formulate the design of sprinkler systems. \"You're getting more for your money,\" he explains. \"In the past, you overdesigned because you didn't know what safety features you were working with.\"Pennel continues to work full time at Aon Fire Protection Engineering as a consultant designing systems, assessing\u00a0failures, and surveying and inspecting installations.In 2014 he received the(NFPA) Special Achievement Award for \"significant contributions to the development of NFPA codes and standards.\" Additionally the 2016 edition of the handbookis dedicated to him in recognition of his contributions to the field as chair of the NFPA 20 Technical Committee.\"Gayle has been heavily involved in writing a substantial amount of the handbook,\" says Chad Duffy, NFPA senior fire protection specialist and handbook editor. \"He's been in the industry for 47 years, so he's able to provide a great amount of guidance for several different scenarios you may run into in the industry.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/team-rally", "content": "Some of the young men were high school stars while others cobbled together a pick-up game on the sandy shores of Lake Michigan. What they all had in common was the drive to obtain a high-quality education paired with the desire to play their sport of choice\u2014volleyball\u2014at the collegiate level. In January they came together and made history as Illinois Tech Scarlet Hawks in the university's first-evergame. Little matter that the team lost that inaugural set against Lakeland College by a score of 3\u20130. Head Coach Katie Zulandt knows the fledging team is capable of athletic greatness through sheer effort alone.\"If we practice for two hours they'll stay for two more hours and continue practicing without me, which is more than you could ask for as a coach,\" she says. \"We have 14 guys on the team right now, which is pretty impressive considering that none of them have been recruited to come here and play.\"Alex Babusci (ARCE 4th year), who also counts baseball and basketball as his go-to sports, and Michael Drews (PHYS 4th year), who played varsity volleyball at Glenbard North High School, are leading the new team.

The child looks at them and figures out the differences between shapes in a very complex way that we don't really understand,\" says Wernick, MIRC director and Motorola Endowed Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \"Machine learning tries to do the same thing, but our mathematical techniques are nowhere near as sophisticated as whatever the brain is doing. Therefore, computers are not yet as good as people in many tasks; but in certain kinds of tasks, they're better than people, generally, when the amount of information is too great for our brains to absorb.\"\"The algorithms are very accurate. They support the police and help them to steer their activities in a way that is fair, objective, and based on facts.\"- Miles WernickThat information can take the form of the millions of pixels in medical brain scans. In 2001 Wernick co-founded the startup company Predictek, Inc., in University Technology Park at IIT, to analyze brain scans for pharmaceutical companies, showing how drugs used to treat pain and depression affect the brain. The company has since grown, becoming ADM Diagnostics, LLC, and has shifted its focus to the use of machine learning algorithms to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, predict further disease progression, and differentiate Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia, so that drug companies can accurately recruit the appropriate individuals for clinical studies. These algorithms also determine whether a drug is effective during a clinical trial.Another machine learning project conducted by Wernick and his team has gained national attention for its ability to recognize patterns in massive amounts of crime data. In 2013 he and Yongyi Yang, Harris Perlstein Professor of Electrical Engineering, were awarded $3 million from the National Institute of Justice to partner with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to institute a new predictive policing program.As Wernick explains, one algorithm deduces which individuals with recent criminal records are at greatest risk for being involved in a shooting or homicide during the upcoming 18-month period based only on specific involvement in recent crime incidents. These risk evaluations are presented in a webpage at CPD that provides police with the data needed to understand and verify the assessments. Using this information and many other factors, police identify individuals at the very greatest risk for involvement in violence. These individuals are visited at home by a team led by an academic crime intervention specialist, a police commander, and a member of the community, such as a pastor. Visited individuals are warned of the consequences of continued involvement in crime, and intervention support is offered in the form of social services.\"Changing the way an agency does business sounds like a clich\u00e9, but Dr.\u00a0Wernick's partnership with the Chicago Police Department has led to a new way of looking at crime prediction\u2014from traditional geographic hotspots to identifying risk for a specific subject most likely to be involved in violence,\" says Deputy Chief Jonathan H. Lewin of the CPD's Bureau of Support Services. \"This approach has had impact not only in Chicago but in the United States and beyond. Despite the challenges and frustrations, he has remained committed to helping us save lives.\"Wernick's team has also developed two additional software tools for the CPD. The first predicts the number of violent crimes that will occur daily, and the other maps geographic areas where violent crime is likely to occur. Many law-enforcement agencies across the country have expressed interest in utilizing the team's algorithms. Wernick will be working with the Elgin (Illinois) Police Department on the project A Data-Driven Crime Prevention Programas the primary investigator of one of three teams selected to participate in the first phase of Illinois Tech's Nayar Prize II.\"It's not done with a crystal ball. It's experience. The computers are quantitative; they don't inject any opinions,\" explains Wernick. \"The algorithms are very accurate. They support the police and help them to steer their activities in a way that is fair, objective, and based on facts.\"The violence risk assessment algorithm, now in its fifth iteration, uses seven pieces of crime data in evaluating risk.\"The algorithm only considers people who have a recent criminal record, not the public as a whole,\" explains Miles Wernick. \"Our ground rules were that we would only allow the algorithm to look at specific crime information, not personal attributes like race, gender, ethnicity, neighborhoods, or last names. We don't use which gang a person belongs to because gangs tend to break down on ethnic lines. We only allowed the algorithm to access standard police records that specifically have to do with involvement in recent crimes.\"\"A New Lab Tool in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment\":\"Image Is Everything\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/energy-expert-illinois-tech-s-newest-nae-member", "content": "The number ofmembers among faculty at Illinois Institute of Technology has increased to four with the recent announcement that, Carl and Paul Bodine Endowed Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering, was elected to its ranks.

Valerie rarely gives me a hug; but when she does she expresses her love for me, and that hug is what keeps me going.\"Valerie's development was normal until she was about six months old, when Aguilar noticed that her daughter began losing her balance and choking on pureed foods and liquids. Valerie slept much of the time, and her pediatrician noted that her head was smaller than average. Her brain stopped growing and so did her progress in motor skills, cognitive skills, and communication.After performing various imaging modalities and tests to rule out Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and autism spectral disorders, specialists at Children's Memorial Hospital (now the Ann & Robert H.

But as a young adult he fought against the Bailly Nuclear Power Plant, a failed project (construction began in 1974 and was canceled in 1981) planned for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, because he feared it would kill the fish in Lake Michigan. During graduate school, however, he again had a change of heart.\"I started looking at the growing population and realized the only thing that could bring most of the world out of energy poverty, without cooking us through climate change, was nuclear energy,\" says Terry, now an Illinois Tech physics professor and nuclear proponent.Today he's helping to make the resource as safe as possible.Trained as a physical chemist, Terry spent his early career working in the United States Department of Energy Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Today, along with his faculty duties, he is the technical lead for synchrotron radiation experiments that the Nuclear Science User Facility (NSUF) conducts at Illinois Tech's Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, Illinois. Terry is an expert in synchrotron radiation techniques that utilize photons to help determine the chemical properties of irradiated materials, which he's using for his latest project: an effort to develop safer nuclear fuels.He and his students are studying whether silicon carbide might be a safer choice than zirconium when used as a nuclear fuel cladding, the layers of material used to keep radioactive fission products from escaping during reactor operations. Cladding failure came into the spotlight in 2011 following the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. Zirconium alloy cladding at Fukushima reacted with steam to create hydrogen, which built up and exploded.Since silicon carbide has been proposed as fuel cladding in more advanced reactors, Terry and his collaborative partners at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) chose to test whether it could be used in light water reactors like that at Fukushima.To answer that question, they have fabricated model silicon carbide films and are comparing the physical and chemical properties of those films with that of silicon carbide cladding that was irradiated in a test reactor. They compare the irradiated claddings with others that have been tested under extremes that mimic accident conditions. The data they collect will help refine current predictive models used to anticipate and prevent nuclear accidents and will inform the development of potential new cladding materials. So far, the silicon carbide cladding appears to work as well as the currently used zirconium alloy while greatly minimizing the risk of a hydrogen explosion.\"By understanding what's going on, you can fine-tune your engineering solutions to limit transport and release; you can also have very good predictive behavior about what might be the extent of release under a specific scenario,\" says Kurt Terrani, staff scientist in ORNL's Nuclear Fuel Materials Group. \"The work is quite sophisticated, and Jeff and the students' personal dedication level has been immense.\"Two NSUF project awards have allowed the team to complete its study of the material's chemical properties; next they will use electron microscopy to study its physical properties, including the presence of any cracks that could allow radioactive materials to leak out. His group has also explored other potential cladding substitutes, including zirconium carbide and zirconium nitride.When or if any of the potential substitutes will be placed in actual reactors, however, remains unknown because of the lack of clear guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\"The goal is to provide enough information to get the fuel qualified for use in light water reactors, but obtaining NRC approval is such an open-ended process that no one is actually sure when that might happen,\" Terry says.Materials Research Collaborative Access Team:Oak Ridge National Laboratory Nuclear Science Research:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/partners-prevention", "content": "In its quest to cure the causes of foodborne illness outbreaks, the United States is doubling down on prevention.In 2011 the United States passed the Food and Drug Administration's Food Safety Modernization Act, a set of regulations and guidance aimed at curtailing the estimated 48 million incidents of individual illness annually before they happen.

The focus of the team's 2015 launch was to test the payload's temperature control and pressure systems, light sensor, and a preliminary communications system between the payload and ground station in preparation for the team's 2016 payload, which will house a more advanced, complete communications system.The 2015 payload zigzagged westward over New Mexico and parts of Arizona along an unguided path of its own choosing; at the end of the balloon's 23-hour flight NASA directed the balloon to slowly deflate, ensuring a safe landing outside Albuquerque.Time-lapse Footage from Illinois Tech's 2015 Student Payload:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/citizen-scientists", "content": "Two Illinois Tech professors\u2014one an engineer and the other a psychologist\u2014are combining efforts in a new area of research known as citizen science, which focuses on the human side of design.For Mahesh Krishnamurthy, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, and Eun-Jeong Lee, associate professor of psychology, their form of community-based participant research incorporates end users in the product design\u2014and especially the redesign\u2014process in order to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.The two began working together two years ago after Krishnamurthy developed an electric wheelchair with \"smart\" functions such as sensors and adaptive controls, intended to improve the user experience. The focus group segment of the design process was particularly eye opening for him.\"With our wheelchair, we originally thought we had a good solution. But the users brought up so much more. Some thought that the chair was too powerful, that it moved too fast, so there was a perceived sense of danger. As an engineer, I hadn't thought about those kind of things,\" says Krishnamurthy. \"It was like building a car with features that no one will use.\"He says that citizen science need not focus on creating new products, but rather improving existing products as well as incorporating participant research into the design process earlier during research and development.\"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, because good tech is already available. We're trying to engineer better solutions, looking at technology from the standpoint of a complete comprehensive service,\" he says.Since 2014 Krishnamurthy and Lee have worked together to teach two Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program courses where their student teams have proposed products to help all students maneuver the campus more easily. One team took cues from the Waze map application to create an online, interactive map of Mies Campus. Their map allows users to post notifications alerting fellow users about issues such as icy patches of sidewalk or wheelchair-accessible restrooms that are out of order\u2014situations that can present unique challenges for students with disabilities.Krishnamurthy and Lee are continuing to test their various projects, including the wheelchair, and have expanded their list of collaborators to include Illinois Tech's Center for Disability Resources and staff at Richard J. Daley College and Harry S Truman College. Along with Illinois Tech colleagues Anijo Mathew (Institute of Design) and Norman Lederman (Mathematics and Science Education), the two also are in the proposal stage for an initiative that would \"create a hub at IIT to focus on the quality of life,\" says Krishnamurthy.\"As engineers, we can come up with new technology, but unless we know how it helps the users our work is never complete,\" he says.\"Building Smarter Wheelchairs\" in IEEE's:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2013/work-centric-prosthetics", "content": "\"To say that he's passionate about his prosthetics projects is a real understatement; I just stand back and try to get out of the way,\" says Kevin Meade (MAE '74, M.S. AMAT '78), professor of mechanical engineering at IIT Armour College of Engineering, about former student Michael Morley (BME '08). \"It's been a learning experience for me.\"That's no small statement coming from the faculty member who was at the forefront of orthotics and prosthetics education in Colombia. Meade also taught the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course\u2014Orthotics and Prosthetics Education for Latin America and the United States\u2014that fueled Morley's desire to design affordable and simple but well-engineered prosthetics. Morley's experiences in Colombia provided focus for his career shift from medicine to biomedical engineering.\"I became really excited about the future of medicine\u2014the different technologies coming out for stem cell engineering, biomechanics, robotics, prosthetics, and microchip diagnostics,\" says the high-energy Morley, a senior engineer with EPIR Technologies, Inc., over lunch at a Bolingbrook, Ill., restaurant. He recalls his \"aha! moment,\" which occurred while working at a prosthetics clinic in Bogot\u00e1 as an international Whitaker Fellow. \"I didn't want to be someone implementing the latest technologies; I wanted to be someone who was developing them,\" he explains.Born into a British family largely employed in construction management, Morley had observed various types of occupational injuries during his childhood. So, in 2009, when he met carpenter Helcias Rubio in Colombia who had severed all four fingers of his right hand with a band saw and had been on welfare for more than two years, Morley felt as though he were standing on familiar ground.\"The insight Michael had was to make a prosthetic tool that is adapted in such a way that makes it easier for the patient to use carpenter's tools; it's not a tool to attach to the end of a prosthetic limb,\" explains Meade about the non-jointed, simple device, which was featured in the March 2013 issue of Popular Mechanics. \"The bottom line is that the patient was able to return to work as a carpenter\u2014quite a significant accomplishment.\"Besides providing Morley with great personal satisfaction, his successful and low-cost design earned him a perfect score on his master's thesis at Colombia's Universidad de los Andes. It also sparked a subsequent project: the creation of IPRO 350\u2014ProSolutions: Prosthetic Solutions for the Working World, which he and Meade co-taught.After developing the design for the hand tool, Morley wanted to see what vision his students had for further developing his concept of affordable, uncomplicated, back-to-work prosthetics.\"The class came up with new designs and the concept of self-moldable fitting as a means of improving accessibility,\" says Morley. \"The second semester, they set up the nonprofit company PALS at Work\u2122, applied for different grants, and won a national contest in Colombia. During the third semester, they built more product awareness by working the social media aspect and exploring crowd funding. This fall's agenda will be focused on performing clinical trials, registering the finalized device with the FDA, and focusing on small-scale production.\"The course won the IIT Stuart School of Business Dean's Choice Award at the Spring 2013 IPRO Day held on April 26. Morley will continue to remain active in PALS as a board member but has already become involved in new endeavors. In June, he taught a ProSolutions course at the Universidad de los Andes that is much like IPRO 350. In July, Morley and fellow members of the International Space Station (ISS) Utilization Committee will meet in Denver to help select ISS research priorities and projects.After flying back to Illinois in August to be best man at the wedding of his best friend, Ray Ballard (CHE '10), Morley will begin studies at Stanford Graduate School of Business to focus on technology innovation. He will continue with EPIR as a consultant and carve out some time for salsa dancing\u2014another talent he developed in Colombia.Morley barely pauses to take the last bites of his salad as he describes other projects\u2014his role in securing EPIR's place in a technological food safety consortium with IIT Institute for Food Safety and Health, and the proposals he is writing with Matthew Spenko, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, on utilizing flying robots in military and industrial applications. While Morley is constantly seeking ways to build partnerships among all of his constituencies, he will remain true to the roots of his prosthetics passion.\"By minimizing the complexity of prosthetics, which I see as being a very [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe 'less is more' philosophy,\" says Morley, acknowledging the master planner of IIT Main Campus, \"we can have very strong and simple aids for a few dollars that get people back to work.\"PALS at Work Crowd-Funding:\"Hand Prosthesis Empowers Carpenter to Reclaim Career\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2016/cleversafe-rising", "content": "From its early days as one of the first startup tenants in University Technology Park on Mies Campus to its recent acquisition by IBM, Cleversafe, now a leading developer and manufacturer of object-based storage software and appliances, has had a close relationship with Illinois Tech students, faculty, and alumni.

One project, a photovoltaic solar array/energy storage unit at the University of the Virgin Islands, is now underway. The project, a partnership between UVI, the Galvin Center, and the Chicago-based energy-solutions company Veriown, is expected to supply about half of the university's energy needs and is the first step toward developing a campus microgrid. Project analysts predict that the solar plant alone will save UVI about $1 million annually.

Behind this titan-sized technology is the combined brainpower of a scientific team at the largest U.S. Department of Energy laboratory\u2014Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)\u2014which includes Jack Dongarra (M.S. CS '73).In his ORNL role, Dongarra helps develop methods for solving common problems that occur in scientific computing by designing algorithms and software that can solve numerical linear algebra problems for the next generation of supercomputers. In addition to his research position, he also serves as Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in theCollege of Engineering at the University of Tennessee.\"Today computational science has become a critical part of the modeling of many natural systems in physics, astrophysics, climatology, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering,\" Dongarra says. \"In order for it to be more realistic and accurate, we need larger computers that store a tremendous amount of data to help us better approximate the real world.\"Dongarra and his fellow researchers work with Titan, the second-fastest computer in the world. The most powerful computer is China's Tianhe-2, built by the National University of Defense Technology.\"Normal laptop or desktop computers usually have a couple of processors,\" says Dongarra. \"Now think about programming something like Titan, with half a million processors.\"The performance of a computer is measured by the number of operations (addition or multiplication) that can be completed per second. Titan, the first supercomputer to utilize a hybrid CPU/GPU computing system, performs 17.6 x 10operations/second, measured in peta \"flops\" (floating-point operations per second). But those quadrillions of operations per second are nothing compared to the technology on the supercomputer horizon.Dongarra says that by 2017\u201318 the hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputer Summit will be operational at ORNL and is expected to be 5 to 10 times as powerful as Titan. By 2023, he says, they anticipate computers operating at \"exascale\" (1,000 petaflops) with an exaflop goal of 10flops and parallelism around 1 billion. Dongarra explains that rather than using half a million threads of execution, problems will be solved using 1 billion threads of execution on the exascale computer system.Dongarra says about half of the most powerful supercomputers are used in industries such as banking, and by companies that utilize the technology to design better products and services.While this level of technology might not be at the forefront of people's minds, the weather forecast usually is.\"Today supercomputers are used to simulate what the weather will be tomorrow,\" he says, noting that computers operating at exascale will more efficiently and accurately estimate weather events such as hurricanes, increasing the potential for saving lives as well as reducing evacuation costs.Supercomputers are not only forecasting the weather\u2014they are also reaching for the stars. Dongarra was recently named to the Scientific and Engineering Advisory Committee for the international Square Kilometre Array radio telescope project. Information gathered from more than 130,000 antennas (an array) and 200 \"dishes\" at sites in Australia and South Africa, respectively, will be fed to exascale-level supercomputers that will analyze and process the data to help answer questions about the evolution of the universe and other cosmological topics.Dongarra hadn't yet envisioned extreme computing when he first discovered his love of computers. He was completing his bachelor's degree in mathematics at Chicago State University with the intent to one day teach but says that \"something happened that changed my life.\"During a final semester internship west of Chicago in the Applied Mathematics Research Group of Argonne National Laboratory, Dongarra realized how much he enjoyed working with computers. He then chose to pursue a master's degree in computer science at Illinois Tech; the university offered him an assistantship that enabled him to work one day a week at Argonne. Following graduation in 1973, Dongarra was hired full time and earned his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of New Mexico, while also conducting research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. By the time he left Argonne in 1989, Dongarra had risen in the ranks to senior scientist and is currently a member of the distinguished research staff at ORNL.Dongarra, who received the Professional Achievement Award from Illinois Tech in 2013, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of several organizations including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Computing Machinery, and IEEE. In his first year at the University of Tennessee he established the Innovative Computing Laboratory and has since served as its director.

Brash and outspoken yet clever and suave, he fires ideas like bullets aimed at disrupting legal practice, scholarship, and education.So far, he's struck every target.Katz has proposed a new business model where future legal firms will resemble tech startups and embrace entrepreneurial pursuits. He has developed algorithms that can predict United States Supreme Court decisions with an accuracy rate of 70 percent and shown how those court decisions can move financial markets. At Michigan State University (MSU), his former teaching post, Katz co-founded the successful ReInvent Law Laboratory, a program that teaches law students computational-based topics like quantitative legal prediction along with Lean Six Sigma business-performance skills.For his polytechnic approach to legal education, Katz earned a place among the's 2013 \"Legal Rebels,\" professionals recognized as innovators who are helping to reinvent their field. It is an appropriate award for a man who seeks not only to arm the next generation of lawyers with science and technology skills but also to transform the entire legal profession.\"I think lawyers have an impoverished view of themselves,\" says Katz, who joined the Chicago-Kent College of Law faculty last fall. \"They think, oh, we're just going to be the lawyers on this\u2014whatever that even means. Why accept those limitations? Why not be the problem solvers?\"The son of two public defenders, Arizona native Katz grasped early on the potential lawyers have to shape the world. The legal field fascinated him but also raised concerns, particularly with how problems and decisions were approached from a law-centric, single-expert view. Katz also noticed that while a large volume of legal data was available for analysis, it was not structured in a way that could be mined for meaningful information. Future lawyers, he says, will employ analytics and software applications to use that untapped data alongside groups of human experts to predict potential outcomes, risks, and costs in a more efficient, accurate way.Katz's polytechnic approach capitalizes on the human ability to recognize patterns and relationships while filtering any cognitive biases through data-driven, evidence-based science. It requires multidisciplinary skill sets that include deep substantive law knowledge combined with that of business, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\u2014none of which are taught in your typical liberal-arts-oriented legal education.\"Dan is purposely challenging the status quo,\" says Joan Howarth, dean of the MSU College of Law, who hired Katz to spur change in that school's academic program. \"He has a much broader range than many academics and is a visionary who moved us in new directions.\"His vision for Illinois Tech focuses on advancing the pioneering work already begun by people like Professor Ronald Staudt, director of the Center for Access to Justice & Technology, who invited Katz to join the Chicago-Kent faculty.\"The work I did at MSU was to respond to the critics of legal education. The difference at Illinois Tech is that people have already been doing this stuff. I just want to continue us down that path and accelerate the pace of innovation,\" Katz explains.Along with teaching courses such as Civil Procedure and Entrepreneurial Lawyering, Katz will launch the Law Laboratory in 2016 to provide a venue for law students to practice design thinking and R&D approaches.

But in business, can the value and performance of top-level managers and corporate boards be quantified?Illinois Tech's new Center for Corporate Performance (CCP) will undertake a \"big data\" approach to find out.Located within Stuart School of Business, the CCP will create a large-scale, integrated database that will include organizational, financial, and economic variables for a large sample of public firms in the S&P 1500 Index. Using this information, CCP researchers will study the relationships between corporate governance and organizational practices and the long-term economic and financial performance of a firm.The CCP is chaired by retired attorney and Harvard M.B.A. Mitchell Saranow and managed by Joel Goldhar, former dean (1983\u201388) and professor of operations and technology management.\"The hot topics of director tenure and the 'missing COO' phenomenon occurring as companies 'flatten' their traditional hierarchies illustrate the type of research we plan to perform in the CCP,\" says Goldhar.Carl Stern, chairman at Carl W. Stern Associates and former vice chairman of the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs, serves as a CCP participating executive. As an advisor to chief executive officers, he envisions how companies can benefit from access to CCP data.\"One of my clients, a Fortune 50 CEO, wrestles with his board over whether or not a COO makes sense for the organization,\" Stern explains. \"Everyone has an opinion, but not the data they need to back them up.\" He adds that CCP data also would be valuable in discovering the direct correlation between executive compensation and performance. \"Rigorous testing through the CCP could help determine the way in which to reward people,\" says Stern. \"We could call on a data set to prove it.\"Currently, management decisions, policymaking, and even academic research rely on primarily anecdotal evidence and simplistic statistical analyses. Goldhar explains that research conducted at the CCP will move beyond the anecdotal and focus on the comprehensive information collected in its one-of-a-kind database.The CCP will aid firms as they make decisions about the allocation of roles and resources and the setting of compensation levels, for example. Not only will the CCP enhance corporate decision making, but it also will prove to be an invaluable resource for academic research.\"We are trying to build a bridge between finance and economics, management and organizational structure, and theory and practice,\" Goldhar says.Creating a database involves more than purchasing and combining information from sources like Bloomberg, ExecuComp, and BoardEx. The data from each of the 1,500 U.S. firms has to be \"cleaned and coded\" in order to standardize terminology for reporting organizational variables such as executive job titles. Aiding in this intensive process is Stuart Ph.D. student Joe Cursio, a former programmer on Wall Street who shares Goldhar's vision of using big data. He will continue to merge data from different sources and define the measures needed.Saranow, who provided the seed capital for the project, says the CCP will rigorously test organizational and corporate governance structures and empower companies \"to concentrate efforts on implementing ideas that have a high probability of positive results.\"CCP Participating Executive Howard Smith, managing director at First Analysis in Chicago, says that while there is ample and increasing data to inform tactical and operational decisions in business, data regarding the influence of organizational structure is lacking. \"With the CCP, we are hoping we can bring some real discipline to this area\u2014real data,\" Smith says."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2012/letter-president", "content": "\u2014Ralph Waldo EmersonEngineers, scientists, architects, designers, and other professionals are hardwired to make things.

One is Commencement. I like to remind people that graduation is associated with \"commencement\" for a good reason. It is the beginning of \"life after IIT\" and, if we have done our jobs well, our students start traveling down a road carrying with them the tools they need to be global citizens, contributors to society, and innovative thinkers.The second time is the beginning of fall semester. I get particular pleasure in welcoming back our returning students and getting the chance to know those who are arriving on campus for the first time. This fall, enrollment and retention reached new heights. Retention, defined as the percentage of firstyear students who return for their second year, now stands at 93 percent\u2014the fourth year in a row we have exceeded 90 percent. Our first-year, full-time undergraduate enrollment is the highest since 1981, and our total enrollment (graduate plus undergraduate) is the highest since 1968.There is a renewed energy and spirit on campus, in part from having more students, but also because of the young men and women who have come to IIT from 94 countries. They bring with them new perspectives\u2014and their presence adds to the cultural richness for which our university is known.At this year's international alumni gathering in Seoul [page 8], I was pleased to report that students from Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United States and Canada, continue to follow in their footsteps\u2014coming to Chicago and IIT for a world-class education. It was a trip that reaffirmed for me that the accomplishments of our international alumni have had a significant impact on our ability to attract talented students from around the world.Members of the IIT community are also embarking on projects that extend far beyond our nation's borders, improving the quality of life in major cities and re-shaping small villages in ways that are both beautiful and profound. Our students, faculty, and alumni are working and studying in countries around the world, taking with them the entrepreneurial drive and curiosity for which this university has always been known, while bringing home new appreciation for different perspectives and points of view.When I look out from the stage at Commencement in the spring and walk across campus each fall, I remind myself not to take our diversity for granted. It is so much a part of who we are as a university that it is sometimes easy to forget that its impact on all of us is significant. The diversity of the IIT community helps ensure that we will continue to look at our world through a global lens, that we will remember to embrace cultural differences, and that we have a responsibility as citizens to continue to make our world a better and safer place for the generations that follow.John L.

Before then, earphones-also known as headphones-were designed for over-the-ear use. Because of its snug fit in the ear canal, an insert earphone allows for greater accuracy in testing, for example, by reducing ambient noise.Professor Aleksandar Ostrogorsky sits near the inductively heated, high-pressure furnace used to synthesize and grow boron-6-phosphide.

This innovative transportation solution, developed by Thomas Edison and Stephen D. Field, boasted improvements such as reduced noise and pollution over its predecessor, the steam locomotive. According to Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin in their biography Edison:(Harper Brothers 1929), New York City initially had been hesitant to adopt this new technology into its railway system until after it was successfully demonstrated elsewhere. Chicago won the technology race when it launched the world's first permanent elevated electric railway several years later. Does change need to be wide-reaching for the product or process that caused it to earn the right to be called innovative? Can smaller, sometimes subtle advances in specialized fields, taken separately and together, themselves be called innovations\u2014the necessary prerequisites that make major breakthroughs possible?The rest of the world followed in Chicago's footsteps.Many great innovations\u2014the cell phone, architectural invention, and wireless remote technology\u2014are linked to Chicago and IIT.

More broadly, IIT Institute of Design Dean Patrick Whitney describes how we are beginning a third Industrial Revolution [see page 18]; institutions such as IIT that develop innovative solutions for design and technology will be at the forefront of this revolution.IIT has a long history of noteworthy contributions to Chicago's greatness, and we are poised to chart and achieve new responsibilities in this next era of invention.

Even though excellent classroom teaching is their primary academic duty, faculty members also have a responsibility to extend the boundaries of knowledge because it is in this pursuit that the creative aspect of education is found and the seeds of innovation are sown.Research\u2014and other creative endeavors\u2014has many starting points. It might begin as a question over coffee with a colleague and then move to a search of the existing literature to see what other scholars have learned about the issue or how they have approached a particular problem. The next step might be a study based upon observation of behavior or a laboratory experiment.All good research, however, has certain things in common. It is rigorous, reproducible, and methodical. Publications are subject to peer review by experts; other researchers are able to follow the process and replicate the results. From the research come more questions, which will lead to additional discovery.It is through research that important \"life lessons\" are also learned. Not all experiments are successful and not all good ideas will bear fruit. Collaboration will sometimes provide insight that escapes the lone practitioner. Small advances may be necessary before true innovations can emerge. And every answer comes with at least one more question.At Illinois Institute of Technology, our undergraduate and graduate students are often full participants in the research studies initiated by our faculty, and sometimes they initiate the research themselves. They see firsthand how recognized scholars go about the task of advancing knowledge and creating new processes and things. Our graduate students, especially those pursuing the doctoral degree, understand that at this university they are indeed \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" and that after they graduate, they are expected to contribute to their fields and mentor those whose educational experience is just beginning.As a professor of chemical engineering who has taught courses to students from the first year to the doctoral level, I have found that my research has kept me at the forefront of my field and energized about my profession. I worked hard to share this energy and excitement with the Ph.D. and M.S. students whose research I directly supervised and the many other students whose research I aided. While the results of our research are important and have had an impact on technology, I view the education of the student during the research process as the most important outcome.There are many things about Illinois Institute of Technology that make me proud, and I am glad that I have\u00a0never been asked to choose just one. However, at the top of my list would be the scholarship of our faculty, their commitment to advancing knowledge, and their ability to share with our students their passion for discovery.It is to our nation's research institutions and the students they produce that we must continue to look for the new ideas that will move our world forward, enhance our quality of life, and protect our citizens and environment. I have no doubt that the faculty, students, and alumni of Illinois Tech will be recognized among the major contributors of such new ideas in the years ahead. We are producing the \"prepared minds\" of the future.John L.

And by going out and performing live concerts, we see that more and more young people under the age of 30 are becoming fans, too.\"Young was, well, quite young when he began to play his first instrument, a piano. Music was a language commonly spoken in the Young household in Chicago's Auburn/Highland neighborhood. Young's parents started all of their children\u2014Young, his two older sisters and two younger brothers (including Rick, who passed away in 2000)\u2014on piano at age 5. Rather reluctantly, Young also took up the clarinet for several years, but weaned on the Beatles, at age 14 he became \"enchanted\" with his uncle's new classical guitar. Young's fingers took flight on the strings, as did his dream to become a professional rock musician.While a student at the former Calumet High School, Young and his brother Rick, also an aspiring rock musician, formed the band The Catalinas and placed third in a regional contest, securing themselves a place in a \"Talented Teen of America\" tour of Canada and Europe. Young also discovered his aptitude for mathematics and science, and his father urged him to obtain a college degree. Knowing that his uncle Sheldon Young (CE '44), an inventor, had graduated from IIT and founded the Vibro/Dynamics Corporation, a successful vibration isolation and shock control company, Young enrolled at the university while forming a new band, Monterey Hand, with his brother.Soon after he graduated from IIT and in between his gig driving a taxi, Young successfully auditioned for the Chicago band TW4\u2014composed of Dennis DeYoung (lead vocals/keyboards), John Curulewski (lead guitar), Chuck Panozzo (bass), and John Panozzo (drums). In 1972, the TW4 members changed their name to Styx. While Young admits that a career in the mechanical and aerospace engineering field was his \"fallback position,\" he says his degree paid off in more ways than he could have imagined.\"My education prepared me to solve real-world problems using math and science,\" he explains,\u00a0\"and to be able to make judgments about advancements in technology as they came along, finding ways to apply them to what we did. A couple of times I was laughed at\u2014I won't mention by which of my colleagues in the band\u2014when I suggested we get involved in digital recording, which would become a standard we would choose to use.\"Young says that besides his family connection to IIT, which includes his brother-in-law Kent Godsted (ME '66), four classmates have had highly influential roles over the course of his life: James Morrin (MAE '71, LAW '76), who was Young's personal attorney for many years; the late Dave Yoshinari (EE '70), inventor of a custom-made guitar pedal; Paul Petraitis (DSGN '71), who influenced Young's musical tastes; and Steven A. Jones (DGSN '71), movie producer and the creative mind behind all of the visual content used on Styx's big-screen tours, including The Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight tour and DVD.\"Dave Yoshinari sat next to me in Engineering Orientation during my first semester,\" recalls Young. \"He invented a device\u2014the Yoshinarator\u2014that carried me through the height of Styx's heyday as a recording act. That thing was amazing. We sat in his basement in Norridge, Ill., and he kept changing transistors with distortion, back in those days, and they all distorted differently. I was trying to play the start of Jimi Hendrix's 'Foxy Lady' and we sat there until Dave found a transistor that worked.\"More than four decades have passed since Young shared a classroom with Yoshinari and lived in IIT's Fowler Hall ,\u00a0\"10 blocks north of the old Chess Studios at 2120 South Michigan, where blues artists and some of the Chuck Berrys of the world recorded,\" he says. Styx has since gone global, playing concerts from Aruba to Japan, and scoring a number-one hit with \"Boat on the River\" in Austria, Germany, Israel, and Switzerland. The band averages 110 live shows each year and has sold some 30 million records worldwide. In the 1980s, Styx was nominated for a Grammy Award and had four consecutive multi-platinum albums as certified by the Recording Industry Association of America.\"I could write a book on what it was like watching from up close as my friend went from cab driver to superstar,\" says IIT alumnus Jones, who was playing a bass guitar in the Farr Hall student lounge while in his first year at IIT, when alumnus Petraitis introduced him to Young.\u00a0\"I was excited and happy that 'J.

But for the past two years, they have made their top priorities running their international floral enterprise and establishing its unique cross-continental supply chain.Inspired by his 2011 study-abroad experience living with an Ecuadorian rose farmer, Lyons, a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign business alumnus, contacted Kapadia to discuss the idea for a global online floral marketplace. Kapadia was intrigued but not surprised, noting that he and Lyons have always been big thinkers. When they were students at Waubonsie Valley High School in Aurora, Ill., they assembled a mock stock portfolio that included shares of Apple. Although the joint portfolio never came to fruition, Lyons and Kapadia individually purchased Apple shares along with other equities. As the market rebounded, they obtained a windfall that provided their initial investment for Global Petals.With Global Petals, Kapadia and Lyons envisioned a company driven by design and distinguished by transparency, technology, and top-notch customer service. Kapadia says that the nature of the floral market often makes obtaining products stressful and unpredictable. By eliminating key problem variables, the company ultimately helps to augment design.\"We recognized that florists are designers first and business individuals second,\" he says. \"The buying process should be easy, reliable, and people-focused.\"A former Kern Innovation and Entrepreneurship Academy Scholar, Kapadia received a grant from IIT in early 2012 that allowed Lyons and him to travel together to Ecuador to meet with farmers, trade organizations, and logistics companies. The trip helped the pair to devise a one-of-a-kind technological infrastructure to move flowers across the globe.\"Global Petals is able to fulfill an order within four to five business days. We contact our specific premium-quality farm, which hand selects and cuts the flowers, then prepares them for shipping to the florists. By working directly with the grower and through our technology, we are able to deliver roses that last two to four weeks long, have heads the size of your palm, and promise reliable consistency,\" Kapadia explains.The hand-selected Ecuadorian farms that Global Petals partners with are located in year-round spring-like conditions because of their proximity to the equator, and thrive in the area's high-altitude environment. Kapadia says that most of the flowers, including roses, carnations, hydrangeas, lilies, and a variety of filler plants, are grown in massive greenhouses that do not require air conditioning, and this helps to keep prices low. Karin Schneiders, owner of Celidan Creations in Naperville, Ill., recalls some of her favorite Global Petals roses.\"We've used the roses especially for weddings; the hot pink, lavender, and yellow with red edging are all gorgeous,\" says Schneiders, who has been in the floral trade for 28 years. She says that she especially appreciates that Global Petals has eliminated the middleman and spends the extra time ensuring that their customers are satisfied. \"I've been very happy and impressed with Michael, who will come by the shop to check on the quality of the flowers, as well as with Parth. Global Petals is doing me a big favor with its great products.\"Kapadia and Lyons are looking to cultivate new directions for their business. Kapadia attended a manufacturing and design certification program this summer at Beijing Institute of Technology, where he learned how vases, ribbon, and other design items could be produced and offered through Global Petals in the future. In September, Kapadia and Lyons attended an exporting fair at Chicago's Navy Pier to explore opportunities for building relationships with flower farmers in Colombia.Last year, Kapadia and Lyons were invited to discuss Global Petals with Santiago Le\u00f3n, Ecuador's former minister of coordination, production, employment, and competitiveness.\"Meeting with one of the then-highest-ranking diplomats in Ecuador was an incredible experience,\" says Lyons, \"and made us realize that regardless of our youth, we can still be respected as global agents of change and progress.\"Global Petals:Ecuador:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2013/common-name-uncommonly-creative", "content": "In the late 1960s, Steven A.

His decision was indeed a propitious one. He became friends with future Styx guitarist James \"J. Y.\" Young (MAE '70) and got the chance to play drums in the band Fawn with Young's late brother Rick from 1977-1981. In 1977, Styx invited Jones to direct an animated television ad for the band'salbum, which would launch a series of projects culminating in Jones's production of all of the visual content used on Styx's big screen tours. Jones and his team created the backdrop for the band's critically acclaimedtour, which was filmed for a DVD at the historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, Tenn., on November 9, 2010.Jones's creative mastery off-stage also led him to a lifelong producer-director relationship with Chicagoan John McNaughton. In 1985, McNaughton-then a freelance producer-met freelance designer Jones when the two were commissioned to come up with a low-budget thriller. Their idea was the cult classic. Based on the real-life criminal Henry Lee Lucas, the controversial movie debuted at the 1986 Chicago International Film Festival. Jones and McNaughton went on to produce and direct, respectively, other feature films, including, starring Robert De Niro, Bill Murray, and Uma Thurman (co-produced with Martin Scorcese) and, with Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campbell. Their latest offering,, with Michael Shannon and Samantha Morton, about a couple whose plans to keep their sick son isolated from the outside world derail, made its debut this October at the 49th Chicago International Film Festival.\"I think what makes our partnership work is that we share a creative sensibility and almost always agree on creative/artistic issues but are quite different in terms of personality,\" says McNaughton. \"The simplest way to explain it is good cop/bad cop, and Steve is definitely the good cop.\"In addition to his work in music and the movies, Jones is producer-in-residence for DePaul University's Digital Cinema program and teaches graduate courses on producing feature films.I studied industrial design in high school and studied product design at ID at IIT, but after two years, I switched my major to animation, mainly due to my feeling that the medium was artistically less restrained. I had a friend, fellow ID student George Eastman (DGSN '71), who opened my eyes to the animation department and the possibilities for experimentation.We have similar tastes in film, storytelling, and subject matter, and I believe we pretty much share the same worldview. These tastes have been refined over eight movies and 28 years. I tend to be a bit more of a negotiator and John somewhat more demanding, so these traits balance each other out in our work.It is a little bit of both. I think that you can also find humor and human feeling in our movie work and there is some conversely darkness to be had in some of the Styx material, but the fact is that the Styx work is non-narrative and tends to be more stream of consciousness-driven. Hence the ethereal qualities!The technical aspects of filmmaking have changed greatly since Henry was made in 1985, primarily the way that everything has gone digital (like the rest of our existence). I'm proud to say that John and I were one of the earliest users of digital samples in our film score and sound design on. These days, I can create effects and layers of images in a day with one or two people that would have taken weeks and a huge expense in the past. I have to say that ultimately for me, a good story well told will win out over technique and technology every time.As a producer, one must have numerous projects in various stages of development to have any chance of sustaining a career. John and I are planning on shooting a twisted high school love story calledin the spring and I've also been working on a project with a young director named Hamzah Jamjoom on film called.

FIN '14), one commodity always seemed scarce this past school year\u2014time. As executive director of Stuart Investments, a student group that invests a portion of IITs endowment to give students real investment experience, he was helping to manage a portfolio of stocks valued at a half-million dollars. Hou was also spending dozens of hours each week working on IITs submission for a prestigious international finance competition, all while trying to juggle demanding coursework and an internship.\"I slept probably only four to five hours a night during that three-month period,\" Hou says. \"But it was a great experience and worth it.\"Hou had studied computer science as an undergraduate in his native China and had come to IIT because of the schools strong quantitative finance program, where mathematical models and computational tools are applied to financial analysis. But after hearing about Stuart Investments during Orientation Week, Hou joined the group to gain experience with fundamental analysis, in which multiple economic factors are examined for their potential effect on markets. He says it was a constant challenge to switch between his coursework and Stuart Investments because quantitative analysis and fundamental analysis require vastly different mindsets.\"Initially I focused more on the quantitative side because I thought I was good at that,\" Hou explains. \"But as I got to know more about fundamental analysis, I felt like my real interest became about combining both.\"Under the guidance of Michael Rybak, senior lecturer of finance, Hou and dozens of other graduate and undergraduate students in Stuart Investments scrupulously researched which stocks to purchase, tracked the stocksprogress, and calculated the return on investment. Hou is credited with helping the portfolios valuation to nearly double in size from the initial $250,000 investment of IITs endowment.This year Hou was among five students selected to represent IIT at the CFA Institute Research Challenge. The annual competition invites university students from across the world to test their financial-analysis skills and their ability to evaluate stocks. Drawing upon many of the same skills they developed at Stuart Investments, the IIT team members impressed the judges and secured a first-place finish at the regional level, beating a select group of Chicago-area universities. Hou and his teammates then had the opportunity to compete at the national level in Denver this past March. Although the team did not move on to the international competition, Hou says the CFA Challenge and Stuart Investments have been invaluable opportunities to develop his financial analysis skills. He also credits these experiences with helping him find his real interests within the finance industry and hopes to find a job where he can tap into both the quantitative and fundamental analysis sides of his mind.CFA Institute Research Challenge:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/catalyst-biofuels-and-self-discovery", "content": "Gaby Sumampouw (CHE 3rd year) serves on the Executive Board of the IIT chapter of Engineers Without Borders, leads a vegan lifestyle, and gives plenty of thought to society's dependence upon fossil fuels.

The program was for undergraduates like Sumampouw who were focusing on the college's themes of energy, health, security, and water.Sumampouw learned that Johnson Polymer Professor Fouad Teymour was investigating how to create energy from algae and spoke with him about the chance to join his research team.\"Biofuels derived from algae could be a renewable energy alternative,\" she says. \"These third-generation biofuels do not compete with food sources and use considerably less landmass than other biofuels, which is a major issue.

It's a big success story, one that is helping both the students and faculty. Undergraduate research is not a staple everywhere and it's becoming very important at IIT.\"Teymour says that Sumampouw has developed acute accuracy performing thin-layer chromatography, a technique that helps researchers identify compounds, determine their purity, and check on the progress of a chemical reaction. She uses the technique as part of her work extracting lipids from algae using a catalyst to produce biofuel. Because it's inexpensive and easy to use, the catalyst sodium hydroxide is the industry standard for production of biodiesel, but the process is sensitive to impurities and requires energy-intensive separations. Sumampouw is attempting to develop a more time- and energy-efficient process for direct in situ conversion of algae oil to biodiesel. She is applying her newly developed chromatography skills to the production of biodiesel using this process. She is also exploring the use of high-quality enzymatic lipase catalyst in this regard.Now in an environmental health and safety summer internship at TTX Company in Chicago's Loop, Sumampouw is undecided about pursuing life in the laboratory. But she is certain that her time as a PURE student lent an invaluable perspective to her undergraduate education.\"Armour R&D has shown me what life would be like if I do decide to pursue research as a career option,\" she says.Overall, this experience has done great things for me by giving me the opportunity to be part of an up-and-coming renewable energy alternative."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/new-logo-armour-rd", "content": "Armour R&D, an initiative of IIT Armour College of Engineering to promote discovery, innovation, and entrepreneurship within the undergraduate engineering experience, has a new logo thanks to Amanda Rapacz (CHE '14).

She says she designed the Colorado and Canyon to attract customers looking for a manageable pickup suitable for carrying children as well as kayaks and at a minimal cost at the pump.\"Midsize-truck customers utilize their vehicles for everyday commuting as well as other lifestyle activities because they need the versatility and want the functionality of a pickup box.

But the discipline of design helps the public to understand and interpret this flood of information. Think of how infographics and interactive maps on the New York Times and other news sites transformed vast amounts of public data from the last presidential election into digestible and often-elegant visual models that illustrated how people voted based on their age, location, and other demographics.While these kinds of visualizations may now be ubiquitous, much of the groundwork for their development was laid down years ago by researchers working in the fields of information design and communication design, including Associate Professor Stan Ruecker of IIT Institute of Design (ID). The focus of his research is to help people more readily interpret and digest complex information.With multiple degrees in English, computer science, and design, Ruecker came to ID in 2011 from his native Canada to bring a more humanities-centric, semiotics-based approach to communication design. His research encompasses a variety of communication-design projects, from developing new visual models for humanities scholars to helping private companies improve their customer-service systems. Much of his current work involves using design and technology to improve human communication, which offers value to organizations of all types and sizes.One of Ruecker's groundbreaking research projects involves developing 3-D visual models of conversations. He calls conversations \"untapped resources\" because communication within organizations often involves short meetings where a large amount of important information is conveyed among multiple participants.While text and transcripts may record what is said in a linear fashion, Ruecker says they cannot efficiently show the event as a conversation with different individuals engaged.\"Many times these texts fail to capture point of view,\" he says. \"What did each person say? What was important to each person? You've got to have multiple speakers juxtaposed or shown in relationship.\"His goal is to create a physical or virtual model of these high-value conversations that could be used to refresh a participant's memory, or be easily communicated to someone who is not involved in the conversation.Ruecker is starting a research consortium at IIT to develop these conversation models, inviting partners from various industries. Several key areas of the economy were identified as potentially benefiting from these conversation models, including health care, education, and government. One potential situation in health care, for example, could arise when patients are discharged from the hospital.\"They're going to be given a lot of information and printouts at a time when they are least likely to be in a condition to pay attention,\" he says, noting that conversation models may be a way to help patients better review complicated information important for their recovery. As a result, hospitals may have lower re-admission rates.Many private companies have already expressed strong interest in developing conversation-modeling systems because they recognize the benefits of capturing high-value conversations. While this concept is still relatively new, Ruecker believes the practice will be commonplace in 5 to 10 years.The current challenge, he says, is to develop the technology and structures to efficiently create these visual models.\"How do you capture what's said, as well as the important nonverbal factors? How much can be automated? How much must be done manually? We've got to get all those pieces in place,\" Ruecker says.\"The Future of Digital Reading\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/keeping-cereal-safe", "content": "Over a 12-week period during the spring and summer of 2013, several thousand pounds of oat flour were processed at the IFSH BSL-3 pilot plant so that consumers could safely eat the cereals and snack foods they love.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 10 food-borne illness outbreaks since 2006 associated with Salmonella or E. coli in low-moisture foods including seeds, nuts, spices, peanut butter, puffed cereals and snacks, pet food, and cookie dough. Many of these outbreaks have been directly linked to consumption of cereals and snacks made using an extruder and from consumer handling of extruded pet foods contaminated with Salmonella. These outbreaks sickened more than 1,000 people and lead to eight deaths. An extruder is a machine that mixes and heats raw materials as part of the cooking process, then forces the finished product through a die so that it forms a desired shape.Several multinational food companies that manufacture these products are members of a collaborative Low-Moisture Food Safety Task Force based at ITT/IFSH and led by Nathan Anderson, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food process engineer. Low-moisture foods\u2014dry pet food, cereals, puffed snacks, and the flours from which they are made\u2014are normally considered low risk in terms of food safety, but food-borne illness outbreaks are occasionally associated with them. Anderson says the culprit is likely the raw materials such as flour that are contaminated with either E. coli or Salmonella. In low-moisture foods, the microorganisms survive for long periods and are very resistant to heat processes such as extrusion.He and his team of IIT/IFSH and FDA researchers ran batches of oat flour inoculated with an outbreak strain of Salmonella through a pilot-scale Wanger X-85 single-screw extruder under worst-case process conditions.\"What we wanted to know was, if we run the contaminated flour through an extruder, would the extruder be an effective tool for inactivating the Salmonella?\" says Anderson, who is preparing a manuscript of the team's results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\"We clearly identified the boundary where we know the process is effective and where it isn't,\" he says. \"We wanted to know if product processed at certain combinations of temperature and moisture content would be safe to eat without further cooking.

Energy providers can conduct more broad-based, real-time monitoring and control of the system, employing such innovative tools as distribution automation devices, which make the grid self-healing by rerouting power around trouble spots and avoiding outages. Customers can use smart meters to observe their energy use and choose to operate appliances at times when electricity prices are lowest.While lower energy prices might prove to be the bottom-line benefit for many customers, the biggest improvement over the existing electricity system will be what customers won't see: how power outages are detected and reported.\"Smart meters have a function called a 'last gasp,' which tells us when a customer is out of power,\" says Bahramirad. \"Currently, customers need to call us and let us know when their power is out. The 'last gasp' functionality lets us respond more quickly to power outages and shorten their duration.\"The in-a-nutshell aim of the smart grid\u2014improved reliability\u2014parallels Bahramirad's no-frills summary of her job.\"My work description is simple: keeping the lights on,\" she says. Like the smart grid this involves multiple layers, which include leading ComEd's microgrid deployment activities; coordinating ComEd's smart grid data analytics; and establishing the Innovation Hub, which nurtures innovation within the company's existing ranks. The latter is a key way that the energy giant looks to reshape itself by training current employees on smart grid issues in the context of their preexisting areas of work.\"We are in a critical juncture in which, from one side, new technologies are introduced and need to be efficiently integrated into the existing system, and from the other side, customers' expectations are at their all-time high,\" she says. She adds that ComEd's new smart grid office will help the company's employees embrace the new smart grid environment and be better prepared to address current and future challenges of this system.For Bahramirad, education extends beyond the walls of her company. She teaches two courses at IIT on novel concepts of renewable energy resources in power systems, design and deployment issues, and the fundamentals of designing electrical systems in buildings. In addition to mentoring students, she is the chair of, a committee of thethat aims to drive change in the energy industry by fostering a more diverse leadership.The smart grid is the convergence of the twentieth-century power grid with twenty-first-century information and communication technologies. The electricity infrastructure was mainly built in 1960s and evolved over the years to become the electric power grid we currently use. The monitoring and control of this complex system, which is also identified as the largest machine ever built, has always been a challenge for system operators. Smart grid technology aims to integrate information and communication technologies, developed significantly in recent years, to the electric power system in order to enable real-time monitoring and control, and to further address all-time high expectations of consumers for a reliable supply of electricity. This evolvement further provides the required groundwork to integrate new technologies to the power system, such as renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and controllable electric loads. Advantages are significant and tangible for the average consumer by reduced outages, lowered energy costs, reduced emission, and better management in response to extreme weather events.Economic and regulatory issues can be identified as two major challenges. First of all, deployment of the distributed generation is costly. Although providing significant reliability benefits for individual customers and the system, the high capital cost of these resources acts as a barrier in their rapid deployment. ComEd is incentivizing the deployment of distributed energy resources in its territory and further purchases customers' excess generation under the net-metering policy to help reduce investment payback time. The regulatory issues also need to be addressed to streamline ownership and economic dispatch of energy resources by ComEd.What I find the most interesting about smart grid technology is the impact it will have on people's lives by enabling access to a reliable and sustainable supply of electricity. We are becoming more and more dependent on electricity; a strong and smart infrastructure is needed more than ever to address our current needs. We also keep an eye on the future by enabling integration of renewable energy resources that ensure sustainability of electricity supply for future generations and reduces environmental impacts. The smart grid had enabled us to measure, collect, and analyze data in smaller time resolutions, which accordingly resulted in finding a viable solution to the problem. Data provided by the smart grid could provide us with significant power making smarter and better choices about how we manage our system and offer electricity-related services to our consumers."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/food-safe-house", "content": "The unremarkable, plain-as-vanilla exterior of Building 91E, part of the IIT Institute for Food Safety and Health (IFSH) on Moffett Campus in Bedford Park, Ill., belies the intensity of the activity taking place inside this one-of-a-kind facility.The building's first floor features the unique Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Biocontainment Pilot Plant.

That night, he wet his bed several times, but his mother attributed it to stress, since Nelson was being picked on at school. In the morning, she gave her son milk and some food, but he immediately vomited.\"My mom called my health care provider at the time and when she told him of my symptoms he said, 'Bring him in to the hospital\u2014it sounds like he might have diabetes,'\"\u00a0Nelson says.When they arrived at the former Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Nelson's blood glucose level was almost 800 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). The normal range as determined by a randomly administered blood glucose test should be less than 200 mg/dl; anything over this is diagnostic of diabetes.Now 23, Nelson manages his type 1 diabetes with a self-adjusting insulin pump that he wears around the clock. A team of researchers led by Ali Cinar, director of the IIT Engineering Center for Diabetes Research and Education, is working to ease the burden of insulin management in patients like Nelson. They are developing a fault-tolerant, next-generation artificial pancreas (AP) system that will automatically monitor and infuse insulin according to metabolic changes that occur in response to food intake and various types of exercise, from solo fitness efforts to organized sports.IIT, in collaboration with the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and York University (Toronto), is refining such a system in a five-year study funded by two grants from the National Institutes of Health supplemented by an additional grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, totaling more than $5 million. The team is building upon the results of its NIH-funded earlier AP study started in 2009 that showed promising results in a small group of type 1 diabetes subjects.\"We were the first group that supplemented glucose measurement information with a sports armband (BodyMedia Sensewear) that reports a person's physiological variables, such as energy expenditure through exercise or sweating to build a multivariable AP control system,\" says Cinar. \"If acceleration remains unchanged but sweating increases, stress unrelated to the activity may be the culprit. That would have a different metabolic chain of events and impact on the glucose utilization than someone who is running five miles.\"Nelson and other participants in the current study spent three days under observation at the University of Chicago Clinical Research Center. For the first 24 hours, they eat meals and exercise and they regulate their own insulin. A continuous glucose monitor and the sports armband collect information on their physiological responses and blood glucose levels. For the last 36 hours, participants again go through a prescribed meal and treadmill exercise regimen attached to two continuous glucose monitors and the armband. The data collected are entered into a computer every 10 minutes and the control algorithm developed at IIT determines the necessary amount of insulin for proper body functioning. In previous trials the recommended insulin dose was assessed by the medical staff and the adjustment of the insulin pump was made upon their approval for patient safety. The adjustments will become fully automated in the new studies to make the artificial pancreas independent of medical personnel decisions.\"The algorithm basically predicts going forward what the blood sugar will be in the next 30 or 40 minutes and suggests an insulin dose,\" says pediatric endocrinologist Elizabeth Littlejohn, associate director of the Kovler Diabetes Center at the University of Chicago, who is responsible for the participants' safety while they are wearing the apparatus.\"This system would revolutionize the lives of our patients,\" Littlejohn says, noting that the team is working with Medtronic, the world's largest medical technology company, to fit the algorithmic software into a device the size of a cell phone that could be worn like a pager. \"They could put on the AP and go about their day; their blood sugars would be managed without the individual being involved.\"In fall 2013, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a very basic AP developed by Medtronic that can stop insulin flow if the glucose level drops below the limit for hypoglycemia. The next generation of APs will have more sophisticated control systems that can regulate insulin infusion rates continuously to keep glucose levels within range and prevent both hyperglycemia (very high glucose levels) and hypoglycemia. While many private and university-based groups are working on this type of AP system, the IIT collaboration is the only one focusing on capturing exercise, stress, and sleep conditions automatically and using them in the controller of the AP, according to Cinar.Nelson, who rides his bicycle year-round, is hopeful that the team's technologically advanced AP system could one day be of long-term benefit to him as well as many of the other estimated 350 million individuals with diabetes worldwide. Although he maintains a positive attitude, the AP system would reduce the uncertainty that comes with living with diabetes.\"Living with diabetes isn't the worst thing in the world, but it is an ongoing challenge to level everything out with my daily activities,\" says Nelson.

But according to Carlo Segre, Duchossois Leadership Professor of Physics at Illinois Institute of Technology, there is still one big hitch: the distance such vehicles can travel before needing to be recharged.Segre says that the more affordable electric vehicles today can travel approximately 100 miles on a single charge, and for some drivers, this presents what he refers to as \"range anxiety\"\u2014a predicament Segre hopes to address through his research.In a three-year, $3.4 million project funded by the United States Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), Segre's interdisciplinary team, including IIT collaborator John Katsoudas (PHYS '97, M.S. '04); Vijay Ramani, Hyosung S. R. Cho Endowed Chair Professor of Chemical Engineering at IIT; and collaborators from Argonne National Laboratory\u2014Elena Timofeeva, Dileep Singh, John Zhang, and Michael Duoba (ME '91)\u2014will design and construct a new kind of battery for such vehicles.The range issue, Segre explains, is due to the limited energy per unit volume (or energy density) available in conventional lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries suitable for electric cars.\"If you could increase the energy density by a factor of five, you've got a 500-mile range,\" he says. \"That takes care of a lot of problems.\"The RANGE (Robust Affordable Next Generation EV-Storage) program is ARPA-E's ambitious funding effort designed to accelerate widespread electric vehicle adoption by dramatically improving their driving range, cost, and reliability. Segre's proposal involves the design of a prototype EV scalable flow battery that uses high-energy density nanoelectrofuel.Li-ion batteries currently used in electric vehicles have the advantage of high cell voltage and energy density compared to previous generations of car batteries, but as Segre notes, there have always been drawbacks. In addition to energy-density limitations, there are multiple issues such as thermal runaway, gradual degradation of electrode materials, shortening the battery lifespan, and long charging times.The group's new approach has the potential to greatly increase the energy density and lifespan of vehicle batteries, while eliminating the need for lengthy recharging altogether. The trick, Segre explains, is in the battery fuel itself.\"Our idea and patent is to load the electrochemical fluid with nanoparticles that are solid,\" says Segre. \"The key is making a stable suspension solution of nanoparticles, which increases the capacity of the fuel to store electrical energy.\"More conventional types of flow batteries have been around for a while, but low energy density limited their use to stationary applications, where the battery fluid can be stored in large tanks\u2014too large to be practical for any vehicle. With the addition of nanoparticles, however, high energy densities can be achieved in a vehicle-ready battery. Perhaps most attractive is the fact that the discharged liquid fuel could potentially be replaced at a filling station in a matter of minutes. Currently, most electric cars must be charged overnight, once their batteries are depleted.\"This idea gets rid of the whole range issue,\" Segre says. \"If you can refill your battery tank, then it's just like using normal fossil fuel.\" That is, minus the harmful emissions.Some of Segre's flow battery investigations involve structural characterization of materials and studies of catalysis events using synchrotron radiation. As director of the Center for Synchrotron Radiation Research and Instrumentation, Segre oversees two ambitious, multi-institute ventures based at IIT: the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team and the Biophysics Collaborative Access Team.The use of synchrotron radiation for battery research has grown exponentially in recent years. Using X-ray spectroscopy, for example, Segre hopes to explore the transport of intercalating ions within the nanoelectrofuel. Segre's group has worked for the past three years on the technology, overcoming several important technical hurdles.\"One challenge in our project has been to charge and discharge nanoparticles while they are flowing,\" he says. \"We've demonstrated that we can do that with a special kind of electrode that we've invented.\"Once a viable prototype can be created, the next step will be to commercialize the technology and ultimately develop a nanoelectrofuel distribution network that may allow for the use of existing fossil-fuel filling stations.ARPA-E:Center for Synchrotron Radiation Research and Instrumentation:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/green-and-meaningful-manufacturing", "content": "Green manufacturing is a hot topic worldwide and researchers have made significant strides in developing efficient production techniques. Yet the implementation of these advances has come in fits and starts, particularly among small and mid-size companies, and in economically developing regions such as Central America. Two Illinois Institute of Technology researchers are endeavoring to bridge the gap between university-level theory and common manufacturing practice with the help of a U.S. State Department-supported research project, Pathways to Cleaner Production in the Americas.IIT Stuart School of Business faculty members Weslynne Ashton and Nasrin Khalili (Ph.D. ENVE '92) are collaborating with colleagues from five other universities on the three-year project, which is backed by more than $1 million in funding. The partner universities include schools in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and the Dominican Republic, as well as New York Institute of Technology. During the initiative's first 18 months, Ashton and Khalili focused on building relationships and sharing concepts among faculty at the participating universities. There were faculty training workshops in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic and a student-focused workshop in Peru. A conference in Chicago last August attracted attendees from nine partner organizations such as the Washington, D.C.-based World Environment Center, in addition to faculty from the six partner universities.\"It's been very rewarding to learn about the issues that these faculty partners face,\" Ashton says, \"and then work together to address them.\" Her Latin American colleagues agree.\"It has been a great benefit to exchange our experiences, best practices, lessons learned, and obstacles to implementation,\" says Rosaura Pimentel Francisco, a member of the engineering faculty at Technological Institute of Santo Domingo, a partner institution located in the Dominican Republic.Now Ashton, Khalili, and the team are turning their focus to research. Ashton's work looks at how market-based incentives and access to capital might spur smaller enterprises to adopt cleaner production practices. Khalili's research is concentrated on faculty and curriculum development, more specifically on the design of cleaner production educational models that can bring about the human capital needed to support sustainable development. Colleagues at partner institutions are leading two other research projects, one focused on the coffee industry and the other looking at whether experiential cleaner production learning opportunities benefit students when they hit the job market.\"These are pilot projects to identify problems and opportunities. The biggest contributions I hope we can make are to identify our core concepts as legitimate and to understand how to customize our strategy according to the context of each country,\" says Khalili.The team's first research paper, which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Cleaner Production, looks at two ways universities in Latin America can improve how they promote cleaner production. \"We can't just be working on the theory [of clean production]. It's about actually getting the experience of going out to a factory, talking to the owner and the employees, and understanding the issues they're dealing with that might make it difficult to implement these theoretical recommendations,\" Ashton says. \"That's an experience that most of our university partners have not had.\"As part of that initiative, Ashton is making connections among Latin American universities and the administrators of nearby National Cleaner Production Centres in order to facilitate more direct engagement with industry. (NCPCs are United Nations-supported clean-production training and advocacy groups.)Thanks to the project, students are learning \"the real situation of enterprises,\" says Yolanda Salazar de Tobar, executive director of the National Cleaner Production Centre in El Salvador, who believes that over the long haul the project will \"increase awareness among students that environmental investment\u00a0is profitable, and as they find opportunities to improve processes they will be change agents in Salvadoran industry.\"That promise of affecting meaningful change drives Khalili and Ashton as well.\"We'd like our work to have a real-world impact, and that's what this is,\" says Khalili. \"Our experience, knowledge, and training are paying off by taking this to the next level.\"Pathways to Cleaner Production in the Americas: www.cleanerproduction-la.org"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/voice-justice-south-africa", "content": "In the South African township of Evaton, a Zulu woman exits the dilapidated shack where she lives with several members of her family and walks a short distance to a plot bearing a solitary, off-white tombstone, where she talks to the spirit of her father, Wine Ndolila.\"We are here about your land that was taken during apartheid,\" Ntombena Ndolila says in her native language while kneeling on all fours on the ground near the memorial. \"As your daughters, we have all the rights. This is our father's land. Halala Ndolila, your land is coming back.\"The Ndolilas are so confident that their country's government will return their ancestral land to them that they have chosen to live there as squatters, even after the apartheid government bulldozed their homes and twice evicted them from the property. The family's tenacity seized the attention of Bernadette Atuahene, associate professor at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law, who has focused on their plight in Sifuna Okwethu, Zulu for We Want What's Ours, an award-winning documentary she produced and directed on the subject of land restitution in South Africa. The Ndolilas provide a face for a cause Atuahene has embraced since 2002 when she did a clerkship at the South African Constitutional Court as a Fulbright Scholar.\"The dire inequality in Johannesburg was so striking to me,\" says Atuahene, a Los Angeles native whose parents are from Ghana. \"I'd never seen so many Lamborghinis, Lotuses, and other exotic cars next to such extreme poverty. I knew that part of what was contributing to this inequality was land theft\u2014where the reigning white regimes replaced an inheritance of wealth with an inheritance of disadvantage. Due to colonial and apartheid-era land theft, in 1994, whites owned 87 percent of the land in South Africa, although they constituted less than 10 percent of the population. Nearly 20 years later, only 8 percent of the land has changed hands from whites to blacks. I knew that this was my issue; it just boiled my blood and I had to do something about it.\"The passage of the Natives Land Act of 1913, colonialism, and especially apartheid\u2014a form of racial segregation enforced in South Africa from 1948\u201394 by the ruling National Party government\u2014gave rise to land theft as tens of thousands of the African majority were forced to move to assigned areas, many losing their ancestral land without compensation. Apartheid was recognized as coming to an end with the 1994 democratic general elections in which the late Nelson Mandela was named president. A Land Restitution Program was initiated to provide compensation to Africans who lost their property after 1913. Atuahene says the huge undertaking has been slow moving and far from perfect, resulting in only approximately 80,000 individuals filing claims.The program has encountered an additional problem\u2014as in the case of the Ndolilas\u2014that is not simply black and white.During apartheid, working-class black Africans purchased parcels of land taken from poor families such as the Ndolilas and built homes on them without knowledge of the underlying land claim situation. With their deep reverence for their ancestors, the Ndolilas do not want to be relocated to another area. They also do not want monetary compensation for the land.\"One of the things that most hurt my heart was when I heard people say they were treated just like they were during apartheid,\" says Atuahene, referring to the restitution process. She returned to South Africa in 2008 to interview 150 land claimants who had already received some measure of government restitution. The interviews comprise Atuahene's book We Want What's Ours: Learning from Land Restitution in South Africa (Oxford University Press), which will be available in the United States in May. Atuahene has been funded by a private German foundation to go on a South African book tour this year to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of South African democracy and she continues to research ways to chip away at the inequality.She formed the nonprofit Documentaries to Inspire Social Change with all proceeds from the sale of Sifuna Okwethu going toward film distribution and curriculum development for a companion course for secondary-school students in the U.S. and South Africa. She has also offered her services as a consultant to the South African Commission of Restitution of Land Rights, which has plans to reopen the claim-filing process this year to allow more individuals to file for restitution.Atuahene says that the international community united to help bring apartheid to an end. She is hopeful that this same spirit of unification will prevail as more individuals realize that justice still eludes many in South Africa.\"All of us who came together to kill apartheid need to once again join hands to kill the legacy of apartheid\u2014land dispossession,\" she says.Documentaries to Inspire Social Change:\"South Africa's Land Reform Crisis: Eliminating the Legacy of Apartheid\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/achieving-real-fitness-through-fantasy-sports", "content": "In 2013, nearly 34 million Americans played baseball, basketball, football, and hockey as well as assorted other games, without so much as even walking to the field, court, turf, or rink. They instead sat at their computers and participated in online fantasy sports, a hobby that presents both a conundrum and an opportunity for IIT Associate Professor of Psychology Arlen Moller. If his research continues to provide promising results, many of these online fantasy sports fans might convert their couch-potato habits into fantasy-fueled fitness.\"Ironically, fantasy sports have traditionally been focused on paying attention to physical-activity data yet have been entirely sedentary for those playing,\" says Moller. \"A basic principle of this research involves taking people's enduring enthusiasm for professional sports and leveraging that enthusiasm to help them become more physically active themselves.\"In a typical online fantasy sports game, participants act as team owners and assemble a roster of professional athletes. Fantasy teams earn points based on the performance of the professional athletes in the team's roster and compete against teams managed by other fantasy owners. Team owners can control their team's performance by trading players with other owners, adjusting their rosters each week, and anticipating which professional athletes will perform well.Although many fantasy sports leagues include significant cash prizes for winners, according to a 2008 survey conducted by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, fewer than 20 percent of owners listed winning money or prizes among their top five reasons for playing fantasy sports. Motivating factors most often include friendly competition, sports experience enhancement, and league camaraderie\u2014forms of social interaction akin to what Moller has also observed.\"In online fantasy sports, message boards attract a high degree of social interaction,\" explains Moller, who continues to play in the same two fantasy football leagues he has been in for the past dozen years. \"That's part of what's so enjoyable about fantasy sports\u2014people can have conversations over the course of the week about the sport itself or different athletes they are following.\"Social support from peers has also been identified as being one of the strongest predictors of success in programs designed to promote physical fitness. In a pilot of Moller's Augmented Fantasy Baseball Study conducted over summer 2013, participants wore a triaxial accelerometer designed to objectively assess their physical activity on a daily basis. After a baseline-recording period, Moller gave participants individually calibrated weekly goals, increasing their activity each week until all of them were targeting the Surgeon General's recommended level of physical activity. If they met that goal, they would attain privileges within the online fantasy sports game. Moller says the most important aspect of this study was that each participant's activity results were recorded on a league online message board, a feature designed to stimulate online discussion.At the conclusion of the 14-week study, on average, participants significantly increased their steps per week (11,364) from their baseline measurement (8,678). With feedback from this pilot group, Moller launched a 16-week Augmented Fantasy Basketball Study at IIT in November 2013. The top three fitness winners will receive cash prizes or Chicago Bulls tickets.\"An overarching principle that I work under is that when people are introduced to a lifestyle change, the context for change should be something they're doing for themselves and something that they enjoy doing,\" says Moller. \"I'm hopeful that if people are considering change for these reasons, it'll be easier to keep at it and maintain these changes over the long run.\"Fantasy Sports Trade Association:Games for Health: gamesforhealth.org"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2014/problem-solver", "content": "Thirty minutes west of Illinois Institute of Technology, at Argonne National Laboratory, lurks a gargantuan machine called \"Mira.\" The recently inaugurated supercomputer\u2014one of the most powerful on Earth\u2014boasts a peak performance of 10 petaflops, meaning it can execute 10 quadrillion (10) calculations per second.Yet, according to IIT Department of Applied Mathematics Chair and Professor Fred Hickernell, lightning speed alone is not always sufficient for today's most demanding applications.Hickernell works in the area of computational mathematics, often focusing on improving the underlying means by which calculations are performed. These stepwise recipes for solving problems are known as numerical algorithms. Fine-tuning them to improve their efficiency and reliability is critical for complex calculations in many branches of science and engineering.One critical issue Hickernell has explored is that complex algorithms may fail to provide answers within specified ranges of error. Worse yet, it has often been impossible to predict when a program will perform a given calculation accurately and when it will fail, yielding spurious results.\"The sine function on your calculator can be trusted, because it's very well understood,\" Hickernell notes. \"But the next simplest thing is finding the integral of a function, and up until our recent work in the last year, none of those algorithms had real guarantees.\"As Hickernell explains, problems involving many variables can be particularly stubborn to solve with speed and accuracy. In addition to myriad scientific applications, such calculations are critical for the world of financial risk management.\"Although one cannot simultaneously consider the infinite number of possible scenarios, one can get a good approximation of portfolio performance or trading strategy success by generating thousands or millions of possible future scenarios and looking at the distribution of the outcomes,\" he says.Hickernell has devoted much of his mathematical career to this technique, known as Monte Carlo simulation, publishing numerous technical papers on various aspects.Monte Carlo allows mathematicians to evaluate problems consisting of hundreds or even thousands of variables. The results of Monte Carlo scenarios are pooled and averaged. The process is suggestive of repeated random bets and outcomes in a casino; hence, the technique's name.In addition to conventional Monte Carlo simulation, Hickernell has worked with clever refinements of the strategy, including quasi-Monte Carlo, where the random sampling is more evenly spread across the space of possible outcomes, dramatically improving algorithmic efficiency.\"Instead of requiring a million simple random scenarios, one may be able to achieve the same accuracy with only 100,000 or even 10,000 low-discrepancy scenarios,\" Hickernell says. In collaboration with Argonne, under a grant from the Department of Energy, Hickernell has been applying quasi-Monte Carlo ideas to the design of computer experiments that will improve nuclear reactor design.Within the last year, Hickernell returned to the problem of algorithmic failures. In a recent breakthrough, he designed numerical software for Monte Carlo calculations with rigorously guaranteed error bounds, giving users much greater confidence in the validity of their results. He and his collaborators have also introduced these concepts to a wider audience, through the release of the Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library. This software library includes guaranteed algorithms for\u00a0Monte Carlo calculations and one-dimensional integration.In the coming era, computers will be capable of exascale computation, performing a blistering 10 quintillion (10) calculations per second. Hickernell's efforts to improve algorithmic efficiency and reliability will help ensure such computing power may be used to the best advantage. \"A good piece of numerical software\u00a0is like a well-designed vehicle, capable of transporting the user from a mathematical problem to its solution quickly, comfortably, and reliably,\" Hickernell says.Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library:\"Monte Carlo Methods\u2014A Little History\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/where-do-iit-alumni-work", "content": "According to the IIT Career Management Center and Corporate Relations, at the time this issue ofwent to print:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/appetite-development", "content": "Peapod Labs and Uppd are both startups that began life as apps created by IIT students.

We immediately saw that it was going to be a fresh, green space for all sorts of new things and envisioned a device that could potentially change the way people interact with technology, especially in the education field.\"On December 31, 2013, Peapod Labs apps had been downloaded 1 million times through the App Store at $2.99/app. Individual apps have been recognized by Children's Technology Review, iLounge, and the iTunes Hall of Fame. Last year, the ABC Actions app received a \"mention\" in the nonfiction digital category of the Bologna Ragazzi Awards. The awards are an initiative of the Bologna Children's Book Fair, considered to be the world's leading professional fair for children's books.Krovblit says that one of the greatest elements he has learned through his graduate program is the necessity of user testing. \"In your mind, you are developing an award-winning, Nobel Prize-deserving, game-changing product,\" Krovblit says with a laugh. \"The way to validate your product is to let the actual users actively use it and try to understand the interactions that take place. You must utilize whatever you have in your skill set to record what happens to make your idea better or decide if you have to kill the project. The last word on whether or not your product is successful comes from the user, not the designer.\"\"Our true goal is to make a difference within the education industry,\" Krovblit explains. \"We want to create a link between our company and something really big, perhaps an insightful finding that enables people to learn more efficiently or to become more engaged in the learning process.\"Jeremy Abrams and Stefanie Bassler were looking for a fun side project last year; he was interning at a law firm and she had just left her job as an innovation consultant. Inspired by video, social media, and gaming, the friends quickly drew up a business plan for Uppd\u2014a free mobile app that allows users to upload videos of themselves engaged in a sporting activity, for example, and then challenge others to \"up\" the competition for virtual and real-world rewards.Abrams launched his first startup\u2014an e-publishing company\u2014at age 15. Since then, he's participated in five other ventures and has worked as an early user interface/user experience designer for Trackbill.com. Bassler earned a Master in Business Innovation from the Monterrey Center for Higher Learning of Design (Mexico) and launched her first company in Mallorca, Spain, in 2011. \"Our diverse yet complementary backgrounds as well as our established friendship created the perfect mix for business partners,\" says Abrams about his working relationship with Bassler. \"As we have heard over and over again, it's 99 percent about the team and 1 percent about the idea. Our inspiration for executing the particular idea stemmed from our deep-rooted belief of inclusion and community. We believe there should be no barriers to entry when it comes to skill competition. Anyone and everyone should have the opportunity to compete, and we wanted to create Uppd in order to level the playing field across the world.\"Putting aside his public-speaking jitters, Abrams took first place in the 2013 Elevator Pitch Competition hosted by the IIT Entrepreneurship Academy and won $500 from Elance Chicago to hire a graphic designer.While app development is still a male-dominated field, Bassler believes the tide is turning. \"As a consultant, I helped to manage both internal and client teams in Web development projects, so it was a natural transition to begin my own tech company,\" she says, noting that Uppd\u2014her first app project\u2014has evolved into a full-time job. \"Women are beginning to take on more roles within engineering and technology as gender role perceptions continue to shift.\"\"Don't get discouraged, but do enjoy the ride; some days we feel on top of the world and other days we feel at the very bottom,\"\u00a0Abrams advises to other students looking to develop apps. \"It's all part of the fun and there hasn't been a single bad experience that has left us without a valuable lesson learned.

The two first met earlier this year at an event announcing Kaplan's latest gift to IIT: a $10 million challenge grant to help build the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship. John Ronan Architects and Shepley Bulfinch will design the building, which is slated for completion in 2017.The co-founder of Zebra Technologies, a manufacturer of on-demand bar code and RFID labeling and ticketing systems, Kaplan says while pursuing his mechanical engineering degree at IIT, he discovered that \"the intersection of engineering and business could provide many opportunities.\" He redirected his career path late in his senior year from a master's in electro-mechanisms to an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. Kaplan worked days as a research and development engineer at Teletype Corporation, a data communications company, while pursuing his degree at night. It became clear to Kaplan that he wanted to become an entrepreneur and his own boss. At 26 he left Teletype to pursue his dream and started Data Specialties, which later was transitioned into Zebra Technologies.Christianson, inventor of the X-Cube twisty puzzle, told the crowd attending the gift event that he has a few things in common with Kaplan: both started businesses in their 20s, both belonged to fraternities, and both studied mechanical engineering\u2014but 50 years apart.Christianson rejoined Kaplan in April to ask him how the new institute will impact IIT students 50 years beyond Christianson's own commencement.Your gift is a really big deal\u2014a game changer. What do IIT students have to look forward to at the Kaplan Institute?The most important thing about what we're doing is that it is for the students. Our graduates will acquire a capability to innovate that will be superior to any other technical university and will lead to a lifetime of career success. Some will become successful entrepreneurs. The endgame for students is that they will be able to get jobs that they will find very satisfying, will be very good at, and will be passionate about. What we will do at the Kaplan Institute is enable them to be very, very productive in achieving their personal and professional goals. If you can go ahead and put somebody in a position where they could do what it is they want to do and it's something that makes them happy and productive, then they will need the tools to enable themselves to go forward and change the world.So you don't think we're doing that now?I assume that you are asking what IIT is doing now. IIT currently has an Institute of Design (ID) that is located in downtown Chicago. It was started in the 1930s. It only grants graduate degrees, and it is believed to be the best design school in the country. The faculty teach design methods and how to solve problems. We expect to house ID in the Kaplan Institute on IIT Main Campus. Undergraduates will be able to access their teachings. Our Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program and Idea Shop will also be moved to the Kaplan Institute. This past spring semester, there were 70 teams with a total of 750 students working on IPROs.IIT also has a Leadership Academy and an Entrepreneurship Academy (EA). We intend to build the EA into a world-class tech entrepreneurial center that will provide a wide range of academic courses as well as exposure to distinctive programming in experiential learning. So you can see that everything is under one roof. All undergraduates will be required to participate in coursework in this building. There will be collaborations between professors, researchers, and students from all disciplines. This is our vision for the future at IIT.I get what tech entrepreneurship is about\u2014where technology and business meet\u2014but could you explain a term you mentioned at the gift event: tech ecosystem?A tech ecosystem is typically made up of technology-based companies, universities, and research institutions as well as other components, such as the government, which is a key player in its creation. Chicago happens to be sitting in the middle of a triangle of tech ecosystems delineated by Austin, Texas; Silicon Valley; and Boston. The Kaplan Institute can play a leadership role in developing the tech ecosystem of the Midwest.If this gift had been given when you were an IIT student 50-plus years ago, how would your life have been different or improved?I'm not sure that my life would have been different or improved; however, I do think that a significant number of people derive benefit directly and indirectly through what such a gift makes possible. In my case, I've always loved taking science and engineering courses because I learned how to solve all kinds of problems, not just engineering problems. I learned to answer the questions \"why\" and \"how\"\u2014not just \"what.\" But there were other courses at IIT that blew me away. My intro to economics course taught me fundamental business principles, such as how the banking system created money and about the concept of inelastic supply and elastic demand. The engineering economics course introduced me to a tool that taught me how to evaluate the purchase of a piece of major equipment or make sound real estate investment decisions.At the Kaplan Institute, we will provide pathways, giving students a menu of practical, useful, targeted courses that will help them pursue their entrepreneurial interests. We will give our students opportunities to learn from the experiences of others as well as through hands-on learning. We will teach our students how to convert an idea into an innovation and then commercialize that innovation or use that innovation to save lives. No single university in the United States has a program that will be as robust as ours.Approximately $37 millionTwo stories at 70,000 square feetIllinois Tech's Mies CampusScheduled to commence in March 20172018John Ronan Architects, ChicagoShepley Bulfinch, BostonHome to the Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program, the Idea Shop, and Jules F.

BIOL '11, Ph.D.14) fills test tubes at her workbench in the Life Sciences Building, her long brown hair under a navy Arizona ball cap she wears in support of the Wildcats basketball team. While Kunkel was introduced to the laboratory as a University of Arizona undergraduate, IIT is where she established herself as a researcher. Her academic path has led to increasingly satisfying research challenges, prominent awards, and the realization that her calling lies in teaching.\"It seems that my plan was always to teach,\" says Kunkel, thinking back on her five years at the university. \"Ive been a teaching assistant at IIT each semester that Ive been here. I enjoy instilling the love of doing research into the students and seeing the looks on their faces when they get what I'm teaching.\"Raised in an environmentally conscious family, Kunkel began her laboratory experience investigating annual plants of the Southwestern desert region where she lived. She also interned for the Muscular Dystrophy Association; this led to her acquaintance with IIT Associate Professor Nick Menhart and his Duchenne muscular dystrophy research. Kunkel decided to pursue her graduate education at IIT and continued her environmental studies under the mentorship of Ben Stark, professor of biology, and Krishna Pagilla, professor of environmental engineering.The focus of Kunkels graduate research was on bacterial hemoglobin and its potential in biofuel production and wastewater treatment. In her masters program she explored how the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin protein (VHb)\u2014discovered by Dale A. Webster, IIT Distinguished Professor of Biology\u2014can enhance ethanol production and then applied that knowledge to wastewater for her doctoral program. Certain bacteria can make hemoglobin under conditions of low oxygen or stress and like the oxygen-transporting hemoglobin of red blood cells can carry dissolved gases.\"Up to 70 percent of the energy needed to run a wastewater treatment plant goes into aerating the water. I wondered how we could make the process greener and reduce the energy cost,\" says Kunkel.Over a 14-month period, she conducted two experiments. In one, she ran wastewater samples at both high-oxygen and low-oxygen levels to observe if hemoglobin production could be directed as the bacteria adapted to lower rates of aeration. In the other, she inserted VHb into the bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea, which is commonly found in wastewater sludge, in the hope that it would take up more oxygen than the naturally occurring bacterium without the special hemoglobin.\"If we could express or enhance the level of hemoglobin in the bacteria, theyll be able to grab the oxygen more efficiently, which means that the treatment plant could be operated at a lower oxygen level. Lower oxygen levels mean less aeration of the plant, which in turn leads to potentially significant energy savings,\" explains Kunkel, who earned a 2013 GEN 10 Award from Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News for excellence in scientific research and a 2013 University Research Honor Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists.At the end of her 14-month test period, Kunkel observed that the bacteria became more oxygen-efficient in their adaptation to the low-oxygen environment and that the VHb-enhanced sludge bacteria did have a slightly higher oxygen uptake rate than did those without it.This month, Kunkel is taking her environmental interests in still another direction as the recipient of a two-year $120,000 postdoctoral fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. She and Assistant Professor Brent Stephens, director of the IIT Built Environment Research Group, will investigate the mechanisms by which aerosolized bacteria and viruses are spread among humans in the indoor environment.Habitat for Humanity:Architecture for Humanity Chicago: chicago.architectureforhumanity.org"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/another-day-another-patent", "content": "Ordinarily, three patents in a single day would represent a banner achievement for a software engineer. Even three patents spread over the course of a career would constitute an impressive body of work. Yet for Resch, a notice from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just means it's Tuesday\u2014he received another patent two weeks ago, another the week before that, and three more the week before that. In all, Resch, 30, has received 58 patents since joining Chicago-based cloud-storage company Cleversafe, Inc. as an IIT undergraduate in 2005.The company, founded in 2004 by IIT Board of Trustees member Chris Gladwin and incubated on campus from 2005 to 2007, markets advanced cloud-based, security-focused object-storage products to organizations that collect enormous amounts of data online. Cleversafe's clients can store hundreds of petabytes of data online\u2014for reference, 100 petabytes (100 million gigabytes) is the equivalent of all the photos and videos uploaded by Facebook users around the world as of 2012, when the social network filed for its initial public offering. Resch signed on with Cleversafe as an IIT undergraduate, helping to build the company's object-storage software for years before its first deployment in 2010. The company raised $55 million in venture capital last year and boasts such customers as the photo-sharing site Shutterfly and In-Q-Tel, a firm that vets technology for use by intelligence organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency.Cleversafe's cutting-edge technology appealed to Resch, who built a 50,000-user Internet chat service while still a Rhode Island teenager before moving to Chicago for college in 2002. He thrives on the constant innovation that Cleversafe requires.\"It's a brand-new technology and a new way for storing data, and there are many unexplored possibilities around that idea. The more we develop around it, the more room for further innovation we find,\" says Resch.Cleversafe outgrew its offices on campus in 2007 and is now based in the Loop. Resch, who answered tech-support phone calls for two years as a student, remains close to the university, living in Chicago's nearby Bridgeport neighborhood with a former college roommate who also now works at Cleversafe. Indeed, the IIT\u2013Cleversafe pipeline is strong: the company counts 19 IIT graduates among its 125 employees. Among the 18 engineers on Resch's team, seven are IIT alumni.Among the IIT alumni working at Cleversafe, Resch is a crown jewel, according to Gladwin.\"When I first met Jason in 2005, he came across as a person with a very special intellect and enormous potential,\" he says. \"Since then, he's proven himself as not only a brilliant software engineer but also one of the most prolific inventors of his generation.\"Once a patent application is filed, it typically takes the USPTO at least three years to issue formal approval. That means that Resch's recent patent hot streak is based on work done years ago. His 58 patents are just the beginning; he has approximately 200 more pending.Cleversafe, Inc.:Top 10 IIT Alumni Employers:United States Patent and Trademark Office:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2013/slideshow-chicago-our-kind-town", "content": "Come on... admit it.

Heavy watermelons, pumpkin vines, and peanut plants grow low. Beds of Swiss chard and other leafy produce take over the greenhouse. Giant sunflowers tower over caged tomato plants. But even higher than the sunflowers is an item that seems somehow out of place in this lush environment: a cyclone fence capped by spiraling barbed wire.Welcome to the Cook County Sheriffs Garden project at the Cook County Jail.Established in 1993 as a place of respite and diversion for inmates, the garden, under the direction of Sheriff Thomas Dart, has grown into an award-winning job-training initiative for nonviolent offenders who earn a certificate of competency in various areas of horticulture. For the past two years, IIT students enrolled in an Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program directed by Blake Davis, adjunct professor of industrial technology and management, have worked to extend the jail gardens growing season. With outdoor space of just over one acre and a 1,500-square-foot greenhouse, the garden annually yields many thousands of pounds of produce that is sold to several Chicago restaurants and supplies a vendor's stand at the Daley Center Plaza Farmers Market. Proceeds go back into the program to maintain its self-sufficient status.Carlos Irazabal (ARCH 4th year) says a unique hydronic solar-heating system was IPRO 497-320Bs major contribution to the project. The system is designed to provide a transfer of heat by circulating fluid through cross-linked polyethylene tubing known as PEX. Installed at root level in the plant beds, the tubing would concentrate heat to support plant life during winter.\"I'm thankful to the students of IIT for their dedication to our urban farming programs at the Cook County Jail,\" says Sheriff Dart. \"These students should be proud of the impact they've made in helping inmates develop skills that can be applied on the outside and may very well turn their lives around.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2013/citizen-architect", "content": "It's an early November morning in a crowded Starbucks in Chicago's Loop, and Katherine Darnstadt (ARCH '05) is laughing. The sound rises above the hiss of the latte machine and jazzy vocals of the piped-in music, providing a robust and rolling soundtrack to the coffee shop. Darnstadt's unrestrained laughter bubbles forth as easily and rapidly as her words describing her views on her profession, service to society, and architecture education. She can hardly get in a breath.Founder and principal architect of Latent Design and director of Architecture for Humanity Chicago (AfHC), Darnstadt is explaining how she remains unruffled when a client tells her \"no\". She instead mines such rejection as an opportunity for introspection and growth. After all, it was a \"no\"\u2014as in, no job, when she was laid off in 2009\u2014that propelled her to put her passions into action, first by volunteering with AfHC, then opening her own collaborative architecture firm whose projects focus on making a social, economic, and environmental impact beyond the bricks and mortar.\"I'm passionate about architecture and design, and the built environment; I can't decouple people from that,\"\u00a0says Darnstadt, her face framed by a multicolored scarf and wavy hair that cascades over her shoulders. \"The built environment is an intersection of design and policy. Historically, as architects we constantly look at the building and that's what we see. We stop there; once the building is owned and occupied, we're done. But I believe our role can begin before pre-design and continue \nafter occupancy.\"Thinking critically about the long-term societal contributions of design came easy and early to Darnstadt, who grew up in Chicago's southwest suburbs observing her father working on buildings as an electrical contractor. When she entered Illinois Institute of Technology, the Bronzeville community surrounding Main Campus was in the midst of revitalization. That climate, which included the razing of the nearby Robert Taylor Homes public housing complex, influenced Darnstadt to focus her future career on affordable housing.After graduation, she worked for three years as an architect for a local firm whose interests included affordable housing projects before she was laid off during the economic downturn, when unemployment in the industry averaged 25\u201330 percent. Seeking volunteer opportunities, she got in at the ground level of the Chicago Chapter of the global nonprofit Architecture for Humanity. She helped to lead Fresh Moves, an affordable and innovative solution to Chicago's food deserts\u2014areas with limited access to fruits and vegetables\u2014via a mobile produce market in the form of a retrofitted CTA bus.\"She's an architect, but her lens is much bigger,\" says Steve Casey, board president and a co-founder of Fresh Moves, noting that Darnstadt and her team designed the first bus for Chicago's Austin and Lawndale neighborhoods, and also recruited and managed volunteers to convert two additional buses for the South Side of Chicago. \"The project is a testament to her as a leader who is extremely customer service-oriented and friendly. I can call upon her with a simple or complex problem. It's hard to believe that she provides all of these services pro bono.\"Pro bono services for clients in need are just part of the social conscience behind Latent Design. Darnstadt took cues from her social entrepreneur peers, nonprofit clients, and AfHC when structuring her firm, which also sets aside 10 percent of its profits to pay employees who have agreed to work for a reduced fee. Additionally, employees receive a finder's fee for bringing in new projects. Many of Darnstadt's clients come from her AfHC partnerships; nearly all of her clients seek out Latent Design from Darnstadt's collaborations within the nonprofit sector. On some projects\u2014such as Femme 2 STEM\u2014Darnstadt serves as educator and design guide, empowering clients to solve their own challenges.In 2011, the nonprofit organization Demoiselle 2 Femme selected Darnstadt's firm to design a 28,000-square-foot community center for young women ages 12\u201318 in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood. Discussions with the client and a focus group of potential users yielded ideas about after-school programming in art, business, and science. Out of that conversation, Latent Design helped a group of teenage girls develop STEM-based program assessment and design skills needed to convert a vacant lot into a play space. In summer 2012, the young women designed and built the Climb, Jump, Leap, and Imagine Playground in an intensive two-week workshop.\"It's been such a rewarding experience to work with someone who can see the intersections between what our organization stands for\u2014public health, community, education\u2014and design,\" says Sherida Morrison, chief executive officer of Demoiselle 2 Femme. \"Katherine engaged our girls to go on a journey of creative design. The playground mimics the Swiss Alps, and represents a place of peace and tranquility in a volatile area.\"Climb, Jump, Leap, and Imagine took the Grand Prize in the Metropolitan Planning Council's 2012 Space in Between placemaking contest. Also that year, Darnstadt received the IIT Young Alumni Award and the AIA Illinois R. Buckminster Fuller Service Award for her humanitarian efforts. Darnstadt was named as one of 15 recipients of the 2013 Young Architects Award from the AIA. A teacher at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an advisory board member and studio professor at the city's new Integrated School of Building, she encourages colleagues to consider how design education could be transformed to best prepare the next generation of students. Darnstadt also advises colleagues to heed what youth can teach them.\"Our profession has always been very hierarchical and top-down, but now there are more opportunities for bottom-up movement,\" she says. \"This shift is allowing for leadership at the level of the emerging professional. You have to acknowledge it.\"Latent Design:Architecture for HumanityDemoiselle 2 Femme:Fresh Moves:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2013/one-step-toward-journey", "content": "It's been eight years since he succeeded Barack Obama in the Illinois Senate as a Democrat representing the 13th District on Chicago's South Side. And just as now-President Obama moved on after eight years in Springfield, Sen. Raoul (LAW '93) is considering his next move as well. Perhaps it will be a run for a statewide office such as attorney general, should current attorney general Lisa Madigan run for governor, or a run for the United States Senate if Dick Durbin retires in 2014, as Durbin has hinted.If it's the U.S. Senate job, then Sen. Raoul would again be following in President Obama's footsteps. Sen. Raoul isn't committed to using his predecessor's career as a blueprint, though; in fact, he was leaning toward a private-sector career until he received some unexpected encouragement from his teenage son last year.It was a surprise because the same son, as a 7-year-old in 2006, told his dad he hoped he wasn't reelected because he wanted him to spend more time at home. Six years later, the son's tune had changed. \"He said, 'Dad, when you first started, I didn't particularly like you being gone so much. But over the years, I've come to appreciate the work that you've done, and I think it's kind of cool when people come up to you on the street and say thank you,\" Sen. Raoul recalls. \"He started crying, I started crying, and I made an about-face right then.\"So while Sen. Raoul did change jobs in 2012, joining the Chicago office of Milwaukee-based law firm Quarles and Brady as a partner in the labor and employment law group, it was understood that he would continue to devote much of his time to public service. (He had a similar arrangement with his former employer, Detroit-based law firm Miller Canfield.)Sen. Raoul's legacy in Springfield extends far beyond labor law. In 2011, three significant bills he sponsored were signed into law by Governor Pat Quinn: one abolished the death penalty in Illinois; another reformed Illinois's workers' compensation system; and a third, the Illinois Voting Rights Act, guards against political gerrymandering.Sen. Raoul has also established a reputation for working across political lines, forging friendships with Republican colleagues such as John Millner from west suburban Carol Stream, who retired in January 2013.\"We're able to listen to each other, able to craft meaningful dialogue, and that leads to meaningful legislation,\" says Millner. Sen. Raoul \"is willing to take positions that are politically difficult if he knows it's the right thing to do, and that says a lot about his character and integrity. He's a true statesman of the legislature.\"In 2008, Sen. Raoul took a group of 50 Chicagoans to rural, downstate Jefferson County as part of an exchange program that he designed with the Illinois Farm Bureau. Sen. Raoul and his guests visited a local school, hospital, and even a shooting range. A few weeks later, a similar group from Jefferson County visited Raoul's district in Chicago. Then the 100 participants gathered for a town-hall-style meeting. Sen. Raoul says the experience helped him understand the gun-control debate in a more nuanced manner, and that it was meaningful to interact with gun-rights advocates outside the polarized atmosphere of Springfield.That spirit of compromise hasn't always defined the Illinois Senate during Sen. Raoul's tenure, however. His early days in the state legislature under then-Governor Rod Blagojevich were marked by stalemate. The memory of that feeling of ineffectiveness influenced Sen. Raoul's decision not to seek Jesse Jackson Jr.'s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He briefly considered a run, but concluded, \"I don't want to go to the bottom of a seniority base of a hierarchy that is dysfunctional, in the minority, where potentially I'm never going to be able to advance any legislation or public policy during my entire tenure.\"Sen. Raoul grew up in Chicago's Hyde Park and Kenwood neighborhoods; his parents are immigrants from Haiti, and Sen. Raoul serves on the board of International Child Care (ICC), a nonprofit that promotes health care for children in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. He traveled to Haiti in 2011 with a team from Chicago's Lurie Children's Hospital in hopes of rebuilding an ICC-run children's hospital in Port-au-Prince that was destroyed by a 2010 earthquake. The Chicago team is returning to Haiti in 2013 for the next phase of the project.The cross-cultural partnership is reminiscent of the Jefferson County exchange, and points to the sort of bridge-building that Sen. Raoul hopes will define his political career. That strategy isn't traditional Chicago politics, of course\u2014but neither is Sen. Raoul."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2014/better-week-beach", "content": "\"ASB has been a part of IIT in some form or another for many years and has grown to become one of the most popular service-learning opportunities on this campus.\"For Utsav Gandhi (EMGT '14) and 24 other IIT students, \"a little house somewhere in the innards of mountain country in wild and wonderful West Virginia\" won out over such cities as Las Vegas, Miami, and Cancun as the getaway destination for spring break this year. Then again, this wasn't traditional spring break but Alternative Spring Break (ASB), an annual student-led, team-building, community-service project that strives to raise awareness about such issues as homelessness, poverty, and social injustice.IIT's nonprofit partner in the ASB experience is Habitat for Humanity, an international organization that provides affordable housing through largely volunteer efforts. IIT ASB 2014, held March 15\u201322, took participants to Pendleton County, W. Va., where they worked alongside two other university teams to construct an addition onto the home of a widower and his two young sons.\"ASB has been a part of IIT in some form or another for many years and has grown to become one of the most popular service-learning opportunities on this campus,\" says Lynne Meyer, director of the IIT Office of Spiritual Life and Service Learning. \"It allows students and the staff who travel with them to give back to the community in a direct, hands-on manner. The reward is immediate and, for the vast majority of participants, intensely emotional. They get to know each other as real people, not statistics or stereotypes, and the effect is transformative for everyone involved.\"This year, more than 75 applicants applied for 25 slots, not including spaces for three staff members and one faculty member who also joined the group. After the team was selected in early fall, members began fundraising for the journey by sending personal solicitation letters and holding spaghetti dinners, food sales, and even celebrity pie throws, featuring such IIT celebrities as President John Anderson.Gandhi, who served as team leader before graduating this May, says his four years volunteering with ASB and such community-service projects as the IIT Big Event have fueled his desire to work in the public-service sector and even pursue a Master of Public Administration degree in the future.\"West Virginia is a starkly, desolately, and hauntingly beautiful part of the country and its people so warm, friendly, and welcoming,\" said Gandhi in the days following the group's return to IIT Main Campus. \"The mountains, rivers, and little towns as well as the hours we spent on the winding roads will stay in our memories\u2014but so will the two little boys we were fortunate enough to serve. The look of joy on their faces as they saw our work in rendering their home more structurally safe and sound was worth all the effort, and so much more.\"Nearly 640 miles from Pendleton County, the early spring day may have been chilly and the sky gray over 18th and Paulina streets on Chicago's Southwest Side. But an array of handcrafted benches painted in festive colors warmed the hearts and enlivened the spirits of the crowd gathered there in Pilsen People Plaza. The outdoor furniture\u2014which nearly a dozen IIT students constructed and erected\u2014was the focus of the Alternative-Alternative Spring Break, a first-time local companion event to the traditional Alternative Spring Break. Hosted by Architecture for Humanity Chicago (AFHC) and the IIT Office of Spiritual Life and Service Learning, the project, held March 19\u201322, was the brainchild of designers Eric Koffler and Jameson Skaife, who won an AFHC Activate! competition with the dual intent of transforming the plaza and fostering relationships.\"The winners imagined benches and walls that would emphasize mural making,\" says Betsy Williams, AFHC managing director and adjunct faculty member at IIT College of Architecture, noting that base colors for the furniture were selected to match murals decorating the outer walls of an adjacent building. \"There are some true mural artists living in Pilsen, so there is definitely a relationship to the kind of piece being made here and the talents of the community.\"Alderman Danny Solis of the 25th Ward made a site visit to the plaza on March 22 to thank the IIT students for their efforts and to get a firsthand look at the painting.\"This project shows both art and practicality, making it very good for our community,\" he said. \"Anytime you can have positive activity within a community it helps in many ways\u2014improves business, makes the neighborhood safer, and adds to the knowledge base. I'm very happy and grateful for this.\" In a moment of serendipity, a group of 45 students from Grand Valley State University (Allendale, Mich.) in town for a cultural tour of Pilsen chanced upon the painting party and surrounded the benches, picking up brushes and leaving a part of themselves in the very neighborhood they came to experience. \"Our whole intent was to engage the community by having a revolving art canvas that brings everyone together,\" said a smiling Koffler, looking at the plaza filled with impromptu painters. \"Clearly, it's already begun to do that.\"The Alternative-Alternative Spring Break was made possible by the generous support of partners Latent Design [principal Katherine Darnstadt (ARCH '05)], The Resurrection Project, and the Chicago Department of Transportation Make Way For People initiative as well as funders Muller+Muller, Ltd. and Friedler Construction.

But in 1967, retired chemistry and physics teacher Ted Erikson (CHE '52, M.S. CHEM '59) was nearly twice as fast, a human projectile in a harrowing long-distance swim whose record still stands.That year, Erikson swam 26.4 nautical miles in 14:38 between California's Farallon Islands and the Golden Gate Bridge. The water was notable for its cold temperatures, strong currents, and deadly creatures, specifically, great white sharks, orcas, and jellyfish. It was his third attempt to conquer the Farallons channel, as his second attempt the previous year resulted in a small snag\u2014his temporary \"death\" due to hypothermia.\"I was swimming, but I wasn't conscious,\" says Erikson, in typical good humor and wearing his favorite T-shirt with the motto \"Old swimmers never die\u2014They just wade away.\" No longer in the pool, he continues to make swimming motions from a bench in the Keating gallery as he talks. \"They pulled me out of the water, wrapped me in a blanket, and finally got me to stop swimming.

Whether exploring panpsychism\u2014the view that all matter, including water, has awareness\u2014or fighting to preserve the shoreline of his beloved Hyde Park neighborhood sun and swim sanctuary, Promontory Point, Erikson is a true force, both in and out of the water.\"Ted is one of the most unusual people on the planet,\" says Vito Bialla, co-founder of the Farallon Islands Swimming Federation (FISF). \"He swims in order to shut his mind down and stop it from racing through mathematical problem-solving. Quite the brilliant man, he is an Einstein with swim goggles.\"Born in Chicago at \"a hospital near 39th and the Lake [Michigan],\" Erikson has lived near a body of water his entire life except from ages 6\u201314, when his family moved to his stepfather's ranch in land-locked Montana. But even there he thought about water, or more specifically, the lack of it, when drought hampered his family's farming and cattle operations. His father suggested he return to Chicago to attend what is now South Shore International College Prep High School. After graduation, Erikson entered the United States Navy. Water drew him to submarine service, then to Key West, Fla., where he joined his first swim team.After the military, Erikson enrolled at IIT. During registration, he met the swim coach, who invited him to participate in a meet that evening. Erikson took first place in both events he entered, the 220- and 440-meter swims, and later was named swim captain while an undergraduate.While in graduate school, he became employed as a senior chemist at IIT Research Institute and dove into marathon swimming in earnest, competing in the 1961 Chicago-to-Michigan City, Ind., swim (\"I took first because I was the only one to finish; everyone else dropped out.\") of 36.75 miles in 36:37; a 50-mile swim of 35:37 from Chicago to Kenosha, Wis., in 1962; and a 60-mile swim of 37:25 from Chicago to St. Joseph, Mich., in 1963. Taking second in the latter two events motivated him to beat the record for the double-English Channel swim between Dover, England and Calais, France, which he did in 1965, on his third attempt. His son, Jon, followed in his wake with seven channel crossings over 1969\u20131981, breaking his father's double record held for a decade and setting the first record for the triple-channel.Another member of the record-holding family was the late Umbra, a black Labrador-greyhound stray that earned \"Wonder Dog\" status for her swimming accomplishments in a series documentary filmed by National Geographic Explorer. The dog made her aquatic debut at the Point, a naturalistic peninsula designed by Alfred Caldwell that is part of Chicago's Burnham Park. Erikson has been frequenting the Point for more than a half-century and was arrested twice in the 1980s for swimming in deep areas away from beach access. After staging a \"swim-in\" and circulating a pro-swimming petition, Erikson and his fellow swimmers were able to keep the entire Point swim-accessible.In 2001, Erikson was among a group of concerned South Siders who met with city officials and members of the United States Army Corps of Engineers about their intention to replace the Point's shoreline of picturesque limestone blocks with a sheer concrete-and-steel seawall. The controversial erosion-control project is still under debate.What is not being contested is Erikson's Farallons Island record, though other swimmers are eagerly throwing their neoprene caps into the ring. In 2011, two six-person relay teams coordinated through the FISF failed to beat Erikson's time.\"What Ted accomplished swimming from the Farallons has never been done before, yet several have tried,\" says Bialla. \"I hope he lives long enough to have someone do what he did.

Over the years, the New Bauhaus evolved to become the Institute of Design and made important strides in computer-supported design and product design.joined the Institute of Design in 1982 and became head of the school in 1986. Under his leadership, IIT ID has become one of the top graduate-level academic institutions in the world focusing on human-centered design, user research, and design strategy.While ID today does not carry on in the \"craft\" tradition of the New Bauhaus, what we do carry over is the belief in experimentation. Most design schools would say they do that, too, but our experimentation is broader, going beyond the arts. That spirit of experimentation has been evident through all of its 75 years. In the early years of the school, there was no formal research; it was all individual experimentation by faculty with marginal funding from companies and foundations. Today, it is much more evident to company and foundation leaders why ID's approach is worth funding.We've achieved a significant number of milestones over the past 25 years. As the school began to develop increasingly advanced methods, a decision was made to close the undergraduate design program and focus on Ph.D. and master's programs. This has evolved into numerous high-level offerings, including a two-year option for professional designers, a three-year option for those from other fields, a dual-degree Master of Design/M.B.A. program, and an executive format master's for mid-career innovation leaders. Our most recent milestone is the short courses for executives. ID is one of only two or three schools that offer this type of program.During this time, we grew research to the point where every tenured or tenure-track faculty member has outside funding to support their work. I'm sure we're the only design school in the world that can say that.About only 10 percent of our students come from the Chicago area. But we're a huge contributor to Chicago. If 10 percent of the students come from Chicago, probably 20 percent stay in Chicago after graduation, so we add to the growth of very bright people coming into the city. It's one of the main ways that we contribute to Chicago\u2014as a net contributor of talent. We bring an international flavor to the city.I think we're in the earliest stages of the third Industrial Revolution, where we have seen information technology is augmenting old industrial processes, helping companies do things faster and cheaper. When the invention of photography was a new technology, it copied the forms of painting for decades before photography became its own medium. If you look at the first uses of television, it copied the forms of vaudeville. The first uses of computers were as calculating machines. All new technology in its first phase is used to help the old technology do things faster and cheaper. That's how computing is being used now in manufacturing and in communications. Larger changes are on the horizon. One example is we will likely move from a consumer economy to a producer economy. People will be customizing the final product, information, or service for themselves. The designer's role will change from designing final products and information, and instead focus on designing the systems to allow people to figure out the final product themselves.All fields start out as informal practices of informal bodies of knowledge. We are one of the leaders in the world\u2014certainly not the only one but one of the few schools in the world\u2014that is building a body of knowledge, formalizing the body of knowledge, in the field of design."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2013/activating-vacant-lot", "content": "Led by Monica Chadha, adjunct assistant professor of architecture, a group of IIT students helped to transform part of a vacant lot as part of their Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course Neighborhood Placemaking: Focus on Bronzeville.

While his idea did not come into fruition, 30 years later and nearly 4,500 miles away, Mies came close to his idea by instead designing Chicago's iconic 860\u2013880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments, setting a standard by which other glass-and-steel skyscrapers of the period were measured.The twin buildings\u2014characterized by their sleek International Modernist style, lack of ornamentation, and the first use of glass-and-steel curtain walls\u2014would further inspire Mies to design the Seagram Building (1958). The glass-and-steel foundation laid by 860\u2013880 Lake Shore Drive can be seen in structures ranging from New York City's Lever House (1952) to Chicago's Inland Steel Building (1958), Lake Point Tower (1968), John Hancock Center (1970), and Willis Tower (1973), and continues to influence the Windy City's skyline."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2013/newness-nowness", "content": "With the spring semester just ended, S.

Wearing a tailored sports jacket and an expression that alters between intense and contemplative, Arets discusses a term some may consider to be as curious as the chairs: nowness.\"Nowness is our approach at the college because I believe we have to start again every single day,\" says Arets. \"Nowness is the moment we are living in, but our eyes constantly see new things. Every day the city of Chicago and IIT starts anew.\"The timeless concept of nowness is the bedrock for \"Rethinking Metropolis,\" Arets's strategy behind the college's new curriculum. He says this metropolis encompasses more than the big city and can represent at times suburbia, the world as a whole, or even a new city type; students learn to examine daily life in all its aspects and the role of the architect in shaping the metropolis of tomorrow. Arets believes the word \"metropolis\" will eventually need to be redefined as society changes its perception of the city.\"Wiel Arets will bring to IIT College of Architecture the necessity of widening discourse,\" says Phyllis Lambert (M.S. ARCH '63), founding director and chair of the Board of Trustees of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. \"A man of conviction, he will establish a very much needed direction, not of form but that of an open society honed by research, debate, confrontation, innovation, scale, imagination, and a commitment to doing well by this.\" Lambert is uniquely qualified to assess Arets's qualifications. In 1954 she tapped Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to design New York's Seagram Building, in collaboration with Philip Johnson.The innovative \"horizontal studio\" concept of the new curriculum emphasizes history, theory, and research as related to understanding and planning for the metropolis, in addition to giving first-year through graduate-level students the chance to collaborate on design projects using Chicago as a project test ground. Arets says that Lake Michigan and the Loop's glass office-building corridors provide inspiration to think sustainably, while all of Chicago can be viewed as a living, flexible, and intelligent organism helping students to explore broader issues while focusing on their community.

Early in his career, Arets was honored with the Mies van der Rohe Award for Emerging Architect and most recently, his firm received the 2013 AIT Innovation Award for Architecture and Technology for Allianz Headquarters, an office building in Z\u00fcrich.Former dean of the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam and president of the jury of the 2012 Venice Bienniale of Architecture, an international contemporary exhibition held every two years in Italy, Arets is excited by IIT's diversity. He says that while many architecture graduates will remain in Chicago, others will return to their native countries to begin their careers.

The activist had been the victim of a brutal sexual assault in her country because of her work on behalf of women and children there. When the client jeopardized her request for asylum in the United States after missing a filing deadline, Mencini and the student argued that the client's post-traumatic stress syndrome prevented her from meeting the deadline.\"Not only did we win on overcoming the one-year filing deadline,\" Mencini says, \"we also won asylum for the client, who is slated to become a U.S. resident later this year.\"That case was just one of many that allows students to work alongside Mencini on real immigration cases at Chicago-Kent's Immigration Clinic, which Mencini directs. Her clients may need help securing visas, going through the naturalization process, or dealing with more-urgent matters, such as asylum requests.As part of the Law Offices of Chicago-Kent, the Immigration Clinic operates on a fee-based system, which teaches students how to help clients while also running a successful business.Mencini says entrepreneurship can be a challenge for some immigration attorneys, who typically work with underserved immigrants with limited resources. She says, \"You are sort of balancing your desire to help the immigrant community along with the fact that you have to put food on your own table as well.\"Mencini emphasizes that the Immigration Clinic is an actual working law office, where students get real-life experience meeting with clients, attending court sessions and hearings, and following cases from start to finish.Her students must learn to juggle several cases in various stages as they would in their own practice. \"At some pro bono clinics, they can spend an entire semester on an asylum case,\" she says. \"Whereas an asylum case here is just one of the 200 open files I have at any given time.\"If major national immigration-reform legislation does get passed, Mencini says the need for competent immigration attorneys will further increase.\"Really seasoned immigration lawyers are few and far between,\" she says.

Rather than hunting for new sources of energy, Shaw focuses on an equally vexing challenge: energy storage.In a pair of new projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Shaw applies nanotechnology techniques to store energy in two ways: through electrical charge in a device known as a supercapacitor, and chemically as hydrogen.Hydrogen provides a versatile, clean, and safe energy source, free of harmful emissions. \"One of the key issues is how we can store hydrogen in a compact manner as the energy source for fuel cells and use this green technology to compete with an internal combustion engine,\" Shaw says, describing one of the hurdles on the path to a hydrogen economy.One way to achieve this is to dissolve hydrogen molecules on the surface of a specialized material\u2014ideally, one with a very high surface area. Shaw's approach involves mixing two lightweight materials\u2014lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride\u2014at nanometer scale. \"The [scientific] community has been thinking of mixing these two together for the last 10 years, but nobody could achieve it,\" Shaw says.Once lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride nanoparticles are combined, the available surface area for hydrogen storage becomes enormous and the release and uptake of hydrogen can occur very rapidly, at a temperature near 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit), which Shaw considers nearly ideal.The released hydrogen from the nanoscale lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride mixture supplies useable energy to the fuel cell during driving. At a refueling station, hydrogen could be pumped back into the storage tank, returning the chemicals inside to the nanoscale lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride mixture. After rapid hydrogen refueling, the car is ready to drive for another 300 miles.Storing large amounts of energy in a limited volume is also a central concern for electric vehicles, which have already entered the market ahead of their hydrogen-fueled competitors. While lithium-ion batteries, such as those used in the Nissan Leaf, have high energy densities (the amount of energy stored in a given system per unit volume), they require recharging for several hours after a drive of approximately 100 miles.An alternative is the supercapacitor, which can recharge quickly from a matter of seconds to a few minutes. Most supercapacitors, however, are too low in energy density to be practical for vehicles. Shaw's version uses graphene studded with nano-oxide islands having exceptional surface area. The new design integrates lithium ions onto the nano-oxide surface (with the graphene serving as the electronic conductor) and alters the electrode configuration, forming a 3-D supercapacitor with very high energy density. Shaw's group has recently patented the technology.\"Once the supercapacitor becomes equivalent to the lithium-ion battery in energy density, you can drive for 100 miles and your charge time is reduced to five minutes,\" Shaw says. \"Then the whole thing suddenly becomes very practical.\"Leon Shaw homepage:Hydrogen and fuel cells:Supercapacitors:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2013/cancer-cure", "content": "For certain forms of cancer, two wrongs can make a right. That is the surprising discovery revealed in new research by IIT Associate Professor of Biology Jialing Xiang.Xiang's latest investigations deal with the biological mechanisms designed to prevent the growth of tumor cells. One of the most important weapons in the body's cancer-fighting arsenal is a specialized tumor suppressor gene known as Bax, which codes for an anti-cancer protein.\"Tumor suppressors like Bax are the cells' police force,\" Xiang says. When abnormal cells appear, the Bax protein attacks their power source, the mitochondria, terminating the diseased cells. This process of programmed cell death is known as apoptosis.If something goes awry with the Bax gene, however, the suppressor's tumor-fighting abilities are disabled. It has long been assumed that cancer patients who have a mutated Bax tumor protein due to a faulty Bax gene have a poor disease prognosis. But Xiang's research suggests the picture is more complex.As Xiang explains, there are two common processes that can disrupt the Bax gene, rendering its protective capability null and void. The first is a mutation in a specific coding region of the gene known as a microsatellite. Such regions carry multiple repeats of one of DNA's four nucleotides\u2014A, T, C, or G.The multiple repeats found in microsatellite regions can sometimes confuse the gene production system that first transcribes the DNA sequence into RNA and then translates it into Bax protein. For example, eight Gs might mistakenly get transcribed as seven Gs\u2014or perhaps nine. If these mistakes are not repaired in time, it will lead to a silencing of Bax expression, leaving the body vulnerable to tumor growth.The second threat to Bax comes from a process known as alternative splicing. Before translation into a protein, the non-coding portions (or introns) of the Bax RNA are snipped out and the coding regions (or exons) are stitched together. Mistakes can happen with this stitching process, such that part of the exon is cut out as well, disrupting the Bax gene's \"reading frame,\" which usually disables Bax gene expression.But Xiang has discovered that something remarkable happens when both of these mistakes occur in tumor cells. When this happens, an alternate form of Bax known as Bax D2 can be created. This hybrid tumor suppressor gene appears to be even more potent than original Bax. The cancer cells with Bax D2 are selectively sensitive to certain chemotherapy drugs. Furthermore, Bax D2 only exists in tumor cells, not normal cells. The discovery has important implications for the selection of appropriate chemotherapy drugs and may serve as a new tumor marker, conferring improved prognosis and leading to targeted, less-toxic therapeutic approaches.Xiang stresses that such basic research lays the critical groundwork necessary for clinical advances. \"We spend so much time trying to kill cancerous cells,\" she says. \"We should spend a little more time understanding them and help cells find alternate means of repair.\"Jialing Xiang homepage:Xiang's abstract in the Journal of Biological Chemistry:Video about apoptosis:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2013/vanguards-advanced-technology", "content": "Shih-Yew \"S.

Olfactory memory is common to many animals, including fish, where it helps guide navigation, predator avoidance, food acquisition, and reproduction. Chunbo Zhang, IIT research assistant professor, studies the subtleties of olfactory perception, investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms involved and their roles in species survival.Zhang's current research, supported by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and the Great Lakes Fishery Trust, focuses on olfactory memory formed during development of lake sturgeon in the Great Lakes. The future of the largest fish in the Great Lakes\u2014prized for both their meat and eggs\u2014is imperiled, as overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss affect their lifecycle and long-term population levels. Zhang believes an additional factor may be undermining efforts to restore self-sustaining populations of lake sturgeon to the Great Lakes\u2014inadequate imprinting. \"Olfactory imprinting is a complex and fascinating phenomenon. There are enormous questions about the underlying mechanisms involved,\" she says.Species imprinting, which may involve any of the five senses, usually occurs during early development. Re-exposure to the sensory stimulus can provoke particular behavioral responses essential for survival. In fish, olfactory imprinting leaves an indelible trace in the nervous system, retained throughout the fish's lifespan.Zhang notes that, recently, the lake sturgeon population has improved in the Great Lakes after the fish were listed as endangered, and replenished through hatchery raising and release into lakes. But questions remain as to how well lake sturgeon are naturally rebounding. \"The concern is that in Lake Michigan, the stocked sturgeon either may move elsewhere or are not reproducing if they were imprinted by unexpected cues from other water bodies,\" Zhang says.This is of special concern as sturgeons are slow-growing fish, requiring 8\u201319 years to fully mature and reproduce. Mistakes in breeding and development may manifest themselves only over lengthy time periods, leaving the full extent of the problem unrecognized for many years.The current project seeks to establish the precise time frame of olfactory imprinting so that sturgeons receive the proper sensory cues. (One strategy would involve hatching the fish in the proper lake water.) Zhang believes this crucial period occurs in the first year of life and involves molecular, biological, and morphological changes to a brain structure known as the telencephalon.A subtle interplay of rapidly proliferating neurons in the olfactory cortical and memory centers and a period of high thyroid hormone activity are associated with the window for proper olfactory imprinting, which closes again as specific regulatory genes are reduced in expression.In addition to its detrimental role for fish, improper sensory imprinting may be responsible for a range of human maladies and has recently been implicated in certain symptoms of autism.Imprinting:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2013/portal-future", "content": "In July 2012, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel joined IIT President John Anderson in S.

The exchanges gave both legal pundits and the public some initial clues as to how the justices viewed these big issues, with expert analysis of the recordings spurring predictions about how the high court might rule.IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law Professor Jerry Goldman says Americans get a better sense of the Supreme Court and its decisions when hearing the Court in action, rather than reading just a transcript or news story.\"The more access the public has to our highest courts, the stronger our democracy can work,\" Goldman says.This belief has driven Goldman to spend decades assembling the country's largest collection of audio of the U.S. Supreme Court. Dubbed the Oyez\u00ae Project, the archive is currently housed at Chicago-Kent and contains nearly 14,000 hours of recordings from more than 8,100 cases. Oyez means \"listen!\" in French, and the Marshal of the U.S. Supreme Court recites the words when the justices arrive in the courtroom.Although Supreme Court recordings have been recorded since the 1950s, they were not initially meant for the public, and until the 1990s, most Americans never heard them. The Oyez Project was created to make the work of the Supreme Court accessible to everyone, be it through text, audio, or other media.Not only can visitors download recordings from any Supreme Court case for free, they also have access to supporting documents and information that explain the context and history.\"In my judgment, there is more public awareness of the work of the Court, and my mission is to make sure the public understands it\u2014not from a technical or legal perspective, but from a simple, plain-English perspective,\" Goldman says. \"What is this case about? What are the facts? What happened to the individual who brought this case after the Court decided?\"Goldman brought the Oyez Project to Chicago-Kent in 2011 from Northwestern University, where he started the project 20 years ago when he saw the potential for technology to reshape access to information and data.Chicago-Kent law students have the opportunity to work as paid research assistants on the Oyez Project and do everything from identifying speakers in recordings to collecting documents that might enhance the public's understanding of a case. Goldman also teaches a seminar on the Supreme Court and has taken students to Washington, D.C., to hear oral arguments at the Supreme Court and to tour the facilities. Past participants have met Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor and on another occasion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Goldman says of those meetings, \"The students were thrilled because they had never been to the Court and had never been treated like [Supreme Court] insiders before.\"With the U.S. Supreme Court archive now complete and up to date, the Oyez Project has begun to expand into other ventures. Goldman's joint collaboration with fellow IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law Professor Carolyn Shapiro yielded the iSCOTUSnow smart phone app, which provides free access to recordings, documents, and transcriptions for cases on the current U.S. Supreme Court docket.Thanks to a grant from the James L. Knight Foundation, the Oyez Project will also soon include multimedia archives for the state Supreme Courts of California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas.

He has been actively involved in the design and instrumentation of two large-scale wireless networking systems, GreenOrbs and CitySee, which carry out real-time ecological surveillance through thousands of wireless sensor nodes in an urban section of Wuxi City, China.Oruklu, an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of the Very Large Scale Integration and System-on-a-Chip Research Laboratory, will oversee hardware and software development as well as related circuits for CR devices.As Li, principal investigator on the project, explains, \"Cognitive radios are capable of monitoring, sensing, and detecting the conditions of their operating environment, and they can dynamically reconfigure their own behavior to best match those conditions.\"In order to prevent frequency bands from becoming clogged with messages, CR devices can talk to their neighboring devices and make appropriate choices. \"In other words,\" Oruklu says, \"CR can achieve improved spectrum efficiency by optimizing the use of shared frequencies.\"To maximize spectrum availability through CR, a process of opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) is applied. This involves not only an evaluation of the existing frequency spectrum but also optimization of the temporal domain (by exploiting traffic patterns) and the spatial domain (by exploiting rarely used geographic regions).Image used courtesy of Xiang-Yang Li\"Although OSA has many benefits,\" Li says, \"a number of challenges\u2014including spectrum sensing, management, mobility, sharing, security, and efficiency\u2014must be resolved before we can design an efficient wireless network system adopting it.\"Smart radio devices that optimize spectrum use require wise governments to implement the advances.

After graduation, while working for a petrochemical complex in Louisiana, he accepted a fellowship at IIT's Institute of Gas Technology. After receiving his doctorate, he taught classes and continued to pursue his interests in conventional energy forms as well as clean energy alternatives\u2014particularly fuel cell technology.Through a series of unlikely circumstances, Magasanik migrated to Australia in 1969, taking a position with the newly formed Oil and Gas Division of the continent's largest company (now BHP Petroleum of BHP Billiton). \"I left BHP in 1972 but stayed in Australia, where I established a consulting firm focusing on natural gas and electricity,\" he says. \"More recently, this has included renewable energy sources and their conversion to usable forms.\"Indeed, McLennan Magasanik Associates was one of Australia's leading consultancies specializing in the energy industries until it was taken over by a large engineering company in 2010. Magasanik was also the foundation director of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, an organization funded by the Australian government, focusing on energy efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. Currently, he works on a part-time basis for Marsden Jacob Associates, offering policy advice, due diligence, strategic planning, feasibility studies, and project implementation.As an authority on Australian gas markets, Magasanik has helped to guide gas-fired electricity generation projects for a range of clients in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania, as well as overseas. One such project involved a detailed empirical analysis, leading to the first onshore development of natural gas on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula.In Australia, coal still accounts for nearly 80 percent of the country's electricity generation. \"We have very high-quality and cheap-to-mine coal\u2014very low in sulfur and reasonably low in ash,\" Magasanik says. This, combined with high-energy consumption for transportation, has made the country the highest per capita emitter of carbon dioxide among developed countries.Australia's mammoth reserves of natural gas\u2014among the largest in the world\u2014have been touted as a means to help wean the country from its coal addiction, as well as a potential boon for the domestic economy.As Magasanik notes, however, Australia's efforts to supplant coal use with natural gas have recently run aground. While an aggressive effort is underway to exploit reserves of coal-seam gas and shale gas\u2014mostly in the eastern part of Australia\u2014the majority of this resource is being exported for sale as liquefied natural gas to the highest bidder. The net effect has been to increase domestic natural gas prices, making gas less economically competitive than coal for electricity generation.With coal yielding roughly twice the carbon dioxide per unit of electricity generated when compared with natural gas, this development is not good news for environmental efforts to reduce coal use. Magasanik hopes that at least some of this coal will be offset by rapidly growing renewable energy forms. His biggest contribution to clean energy development is through Hepburn Wind, Australia's first community-owned wind farm, located in Victoria, near the Wombat State Forest.Local residents, frustrated with government inertia on climate change, decided to take their own initiative and launched the ambitious clean-energy project in 2007, with generation commencing in June 2012. Magasanik currently serves on the board of Hepburn Wind, which features a pair of 2.05 megawatt high-tech wind turbines. The turbines, capable of powering more than 2,000 homes in the surrounding area, were affectionately dubbed Gale and Gusto by a youngster who won a naming competition among community schoolchildren.The naming contest is an example of the cooperative spirit of the project, which has benefitted from enthusiastic public engagement since the outset. \"We raised almost $10 million from cooperative members, of which there are around 2,000,\" Magasanik says. \"Our borrowings are under $2 million and in addition we received grants of almost $2 million from the state government.\"In addition to electricity, area participants benefit from a generous community sustainability fund, which has provided grants for a broad range of projects to nourish the local area. These include investigations of novel species in the nearby Wombat State Forest and investment in Men's Sheds, a flourishing countrywide program designed to improve health and foster social interaction.Hepburn Wind's modest farm is expected to offset some 12,200 tons of carbon dioxide\u2014the equivalent of planting 45,523 trees every year. The project has inspired green initiatives for wind, solar, bioenergy, and mini-hydro projects across Australia.\"We are the successful example of what can be done,\" Magasanik says.Hepburn Wind:Australia's natural gas boom: grattan.edu.au/publications/reports/post/getting-gas-right-australias-energy-challenge"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2013/europe-rising-research-challenge-germany", "content": "This summer, six IIT undergraduates were given the chance \"to rise up and go beyond\" by expanding their educational and cultural horizons through the Research Internships in Science and Engineering (RISE) program.

If he's angry, he turns red and if he's afraid or not feeling well, he turns extremely pale or light tan.

As the photographer moves in for the animal's close-up shot, the octopus responds by changing texture as if cautious, but only momentarily.Shaughnessy, a Camras Scholar who hails from Maine, approached Terschak about doing marine-chemical ecology research for his senior thesis. Terschak spent years helping to elucidate the sexual pheromone associated with the female green crab and spoke with Shaughnessy about an aquaculture pest-management project using natural chemical products. Current anecdotal evidence indicates thatmay emit a chemical that repels green crabs, an invasive pest species now populating the west coast from San Francisco Bay to Vancouver.With funding from CSL and the Office of Undergraduate Research, Shaughnessy designed and set up the 25' x 11' lab equipped with two recirculating seawater aquariums and an experimental water channel, or flume system. Twelve crabs are the flume test subjects and the others serve as food for the octopus.Shaughnessy oversees the flume trials, which involve comparing a video of a crab's behavior in control seawater and \"octopus-conditioned\" seawater\u2014water in which the octopus has lived in for 8\u201310 hours. Preliminary results indicate that crabs respond differently in the two waters, moving upstream in the flume at a fairly fast velocity in the control water and much more slowly when octopus water is pumped in. Downstream, the crab rests far from the source of the inflow of octopus water. The same experiment will be conducted when the octopus's food changes from green crabs to bivalve mussels for a six-week period.Once the chemical-ecology team secures enough data to support their repellent hypothesis, they'll fractionate the compounds in the water into classes in order to narrow the search for the specific chemical, if they can find the funding to continue.

These detectors can uncover certain nuclear materials that emit neutrons in addition to more commonly emitted radioactive-charged particles such as X-rays and gamma rays.The nontoxic, nonradioactive helium-3 isotope was for many years readily harvested as a decay byproduct of tritium, a material used as a booster in nuclear weapons. Due to the decline of the nuclear weapons programs in the United States and Russia, as well as safety issues within the reactors that produced the tritium, the U.S. stopped tritium production in 1998; this has resulted in reduced global helium-3 production to a fraction of the previous levels. According to a Congressional Research Service Report from December 2010, helium-3 demand has exceeded production since 2001.Ostrogorsky and Slack, both on faculty at IIT Armour College of Engineering, have successfully prepared a high-purity powder form of the compound. Research Associate Ken Morgan, with extensive experience in growing wide band-gap semiconductors, joined the pair last September. Currently, he is trying to melt the powder at temperatures above 2,150\u00b0C (4,000\u00b0F) to produce a single semiconducting crystal through a slow and precise solidification process. The single crystals will then be processed into wafers, polished and annealed, and used to fabricate neutron-detecting devices.\"If we get good results, there will be many opportunities to commercialize our efforts through a startup,\" says Ostrogorsky. \"Boron is a superb neutron absorber and we expect B6P to have good semiconductor properties.

And losing-whether it's in one-on-one play like tennis, or in a team sport such as football-can create negative thinking, which lowers athletes' confidence in their abilities.\"Many people don't know how to rebound from mistakes,\" O'Connor says. \"When educating young athletes, mental training must be an important part of their conditioning.\" While O'Connor works predominantly with high school and college athletes, he has also helped Olympic hopefuls, Junior Olympians, and golfers perform better by teaching them how to decrease stress through focus, concentration, confidence, and arousal regulation.Focus requires intention and goal setting. \"If you want to achieve something, you have to give it your all,\" O'Connor says. \"One of my mottoes is, 'Average isn't good enough.'\"Concentration involves focused attention toward achieving a goal, while confidence means believing the goal can be achieved.

Are you playing for fun, or is your goal to have a career in the NFL?\"Besides helping athletes achieve their goals, O'Connor says the lessons of sport psychology transcend just sports. \"I want to put sport psychology on the front page,\" he says. \"If people learn how to deal with winning and losing in all situations, that will improve everyone's quality of life and make the world a better place.\"IIT College of Psychology:O'Connor's website:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2012/now-hear", "content": "In 1984, a gumdrop-sized object developed at Etymotic Research, Inc. turned the world of electroacoustics on its, well, ear. The squat cylinder, doughy like a gumdrop except for a length of thin, flexible tubing at one end, was a foam eartip with a unique distinction: it sealed the ear from outside ambient noise while delivering test tones and speech through the world's first \"tubephone\" insert earphone. Before then, earphones-also known as headphones-were designed for over-the-ear use. Because of its snug fit in the ear canal, an insert earphone allows for greater accuracy in testing, for example, by reducing ambient noise.\"The best seal you can get for the ear is foam that can be rolled down, put into the ear, and locked into place by expansion,\" explains Mead Killion (M.S. MATH '70), Etymotic's founder, president, and chief technology officer. At Illinois Institute of Technology as part of Chicago Ideas Week last October, Killion pinched and rolled a gold-foil-wrapped version of the eartip between thumb and forefinger, then watched it re-conform to its original shape.\"If you put a tube into the foam, you'll still have noise isolation, but now you could put sound into the ear,\" he adds. The gold foil wrapping was a later innovation, which made possible a comfortable electrical pickup deep in the ear canal for determining auditory brainstem response (ABR), a standard test that detects electrical signals to measure hearing and neurologic function in infants, children, and adults.Since that first eartip, Etymotic, which means \"true to the ear,\" has obtained more than 80 patents and has achieved a number of \"world's first\" titles for its products, which comprise instrumentation for auditory testing; insert earphones for music enhancement, as well as hearing protection; and hearing aid components. Killion's early background in music and mechanics prepared him for perfecting devices that would allow artists to hear such subtleties as a singer's intake of breath while at the same time protecting their inner ears' hair cells against excessive noise.In the first grade, Killion began taking piano lessons, soon followed by the violin. As a young adult, he enjoyed rewiring junk jukeboxes and working under the hood of his 1939 Chevy with equal verve. Ham radio came later, as well as machine shop experience at Steel Industries while he was working his way through Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Ind. A fraternity brother knew of Killion's interests and math aptitude, and urged him to interview for a job assisting hearing aid pioneer Elmer Carlson at Knowles Electronics in Itasca, Ill. Killion remained at Knowles for more than 20 years and left to start Etymotic with the rights to three projects he initiated under Carlson-the insert earphone, a high-fidelity hearing aid circuit, and an ABR testing device for infants. He earned his doctorate in audiology at Northwestern University, where he continues to teach a course in hearing aid electroacoustics.Still running half-marathons at 72, Killion is known as much for his longtime advocacy for hearing protection as for his innovative products and handlebar mustache, a caricature of which is engraved on the circuitry of Etymotic's K-AMP high-fidelity hearing aids (along with the initials of all 10 engineers who helped develop the chip). After consulting with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1985, Killion introduced them to custom-molded Musician's Earplugs, developed by his early mentor Carlson, which provide a choice of three levels of sound reduction.In 1991, Etymotic debuted the ER-4 series-the fourth-generation of Etymotic insert earphones-as the world's first noise-isolating, high-fidelity earphones, reproducing sound that is at least 90 percent as accurate as a live performance while protecting artists from 98 percent of noise.\"Over the last few years, I have written and produced nearly 100 songs for 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' which means thousands of hours are spent monitoring sounds while composing and mixing,\" says Earl Talbot Jr., drummer with Poi Dog Pondering, music producer, and founder of The Drum School of music instruction. \"The ER-4s are now an integral part of the experience, allowing for a true reference at a much lower volume level.\"The company introduced the world's first Bluetooth stereo earphones in 2006, reducing ambient noise levels by 30 decibels, followed by an iPhone headset two years later. More recently, an unexpected encounter on a flight showed Killion that his company's reputation has entered the stratosphere. Upgraded to first class, he saw the co-pilot step out of the cockpit and speak with a flight attendant about the noise filling the small compartment. Killion approached the co-pilot and handed him a pair of Etymotic ER-20s, which reduce most noise to safe levels while maintaining clearly audible speech.\"He looked at the earplugs and the name, then pulled a slip of paper out of his pocket. Turns out the pilot had just told him to buy some!\" says Killion. \"It's very gratifying to actually see that, rather than know just from your sales that your products are making a difference.\"Etymotic Research, Inc.:\"Metallica, Music, and Mead: An Interview with Mead Killion, Ph.D.\":"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2012/unlocking-big-data", "content": "On an average day in cyberspace, 200 million \"tweets\" on topics ranging from pet behavior to political struggles circle the globe.This chatter is a virtual treasure trove for advertisers and corporations who would like to harness it to learn more about public attitudes and trends.

The Twitter universe is the sort of vast, unstructured data set that BigSheets excels at mining and deciphering. \"We're looking for various tools that can crawl the social media, analyze them, and give back insights into data, in a very neat, intuitive manner,\" he says.Like a virtual intelligence agency, BigSheets can trawl through the entire planet's online chatter over hours, days, or months, ferreting out pertinent remarks from the enormous haystack of unrelated commentary.The information that BigSheets gathers is typically outputted as a very large spreadsheet, hence the name. But Krishnareddy has also worked on data-visualization plug-ins that allow huge data sets to be grasped visually, leveraging previous IBM tools, including one named Many Eyes, which allows the data to be configured as a bubble graphic.Once BigSheets has gathered its gigantic data set of tweets, it goes about interpreting them, using IBM natural language processing technologies. These were demonstrated to uncanny effect when Watson\u2014IBM's \"Jeopardy!\"-playing phenomenon\u2014trounced its human competitors in 2011.As Krishnareddy explains, BigSheets uses related language software to carry out sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets, zeroing in on how people are reacting to business products and services, upcoming films, and political candidates, to name but a few.And Twitter is only the beginning.

Joseph Orgel, IIT associate professor of biology and biomedical engineering, is leading a research team that is studying how protein sequences persisting in dinosaur bone may offer clues for understanding closely related collagen forms found in humans. Its findings, published in the science and medicine journal PLoS ONE and featured in Nature, could usher in a new era of collagen-based medical applications.The team examined peptide sequences from two prehistoric creatures, defying long-held assumptions that collagen degrades to non-existence over such extreme time spans. \"Even if the collagen samples had survived only thousands of years, it would be profound,\" Orgel says.Orgel reasoned that the persistence of these collagen remnants was due to their location within bone, which is naturally mineralized in living tissue. Fossilization of the bone fragments further protected them from bacterial decomposition.But there was more to the story.The team discovered a consistency in the protein sequences that managed to survive degradation. When compared with collagen sequences observed in humans and rats, it became clear that the dinosaur collagen snippets belonged to regions that were physically sheltered within the ropelike structure of the protein and thus, protected from the ravages of time.\"Parts of the collagen molecule are obscured until the cell cuts into the surface of the fibril or when the fibril is injured, say, in the context of a sports injury,\" Orgel explains. \"When either of those processes occur, these previously sheltered regions actually provide instructions to the cells in tissue about what to do next. So collagen is not just a scaffolding-it's an instruction manual as well.\"Wound-healing techniques that employ collagen dressings are already widespread. More exotic therapies may be used eventually to treat collagen-related diseases, including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial heart ailments, and other conditions.Perhaps most exciting is the prospect for producing replacement body parts-including joints, vertebrae, and skin-and the creation of transplantable organs built on a scaffolding of collagen and seeded with the recipient's own stem cells.

I think about that a lot. If I had taken other people's advice, would I have taken the chances that now have made me a success?\"Calamos has gained wide respect not just for taking risks but also for knowing how to manage them, a skill for which he credits his five years in the Air Force, which included a tour in Vietnam. His service began when he joined the IIT ROTC program, a decision he made because he thought he might like to fly planes. Just one course short of completing his M.B.A., Calamos received his notice to report to active duty.\"Within 12 months, I went from being a kid from Chicago's West Side who knew only what an airplane was to flying supersonic jets in formation, at night,\" he recalls in a conversation from the executive library of the sleek Calamos Investments Building in west suburban Naperville, Ill. As he points out models of various planes he has flown-a private, fun airplane called a Marchetti SF-260, an A-37 fighter jet, the supersonic T-38, Learjet, and a Citation X-that line his library's bookshelves, he recounts that he left the service as a major with his pilot's wings, as well as \nwith lessons learned in leadership, camaraderie, and risk management.\"Ensure that you educate yourself about the risk, then try to think about what might go wrong and \nwhat you would do,\" says Calamos, who over time dealt with such incidents as piloting a B-52 with an engine on fire. \"Parallel to investing, there are so many factors influencing the outcomes; you try to quantify as many as possible. But there are still those outlier risks. You could know everything about the airplane, but if you end up flying in a thunderstorm-whoosh-it all goes away.\"Contemplating a situation and then making an informed and logical decision regarding its outcome seem second nature for Calamos, who frequently poses thought-provoking, rhetorical questions in the manner of Socrates, known for his ancient inquiry and debate methodology that stimulated critical thinking and ideation. Calamos says his introduction to such philosophers through his undergraduate coursework taught him how to really think.\"Philosophy asks, 'What assumptions did you use here and why did you use them?' To me, [my philosophy education] was eye-opening,\" he says, noting that as a young boy growing up in the Greek Orthodox church, his global view was very narrow from a religious point of view. That all changed when he went to college and gained knowledge about the history of philosophy. While his interest in finance was triggered by his teenage discovery of Depression-era stock certificates in the basement of his parents' home, he remains fascinated by the markets-\"the pulse of how we feel\"-because of their close relationship with the world at large.An IIT trustee, Calamos, along with his wife, Mae, have committed $10 million to establish two endowed chairs at the university-to support a professor of philosophy at IIT College of Science and Letters, and to support the dean of IIT Stuart School of Business.

Vertical farming-the cultivation of crops in vertical, typically indoor, spaces such as urban buildings and skyscrapers-is seen by many as a new frontier in food production, allowing the otherwise unused urban spaces to provide fresh-grown produce for the local community and businesses.In 2009, IIT Industrial Technology and Management faculty member Blake Davis began an Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program course in which students were assigned to plan a vertical farm for the Chicago Sustainable Manufacturing Center, a new endeavor founded by John Edel. The students first tested a few prototype farm beds and then developed a formal plan for the farm after Edel succeeded in securing a 93,000-square-foot former meatpacking plant previously owned by Peer Foods in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. Over the course of several semesters, the IPRO students tested and implemented several components of Edel's project-known simply as The Plant-including an aquaponic farm that combines raising tilapia with the cultivation of hydroponic crops, creating complementary systems in which the waste produced by the fish provides fertilizer for the crops, which in turn clean the water in which the fish live.This concept of using complementary systems to eliminate waste is writ large throughout The Plant, which is in the process of becoming a fully self-sufficient, zero-waste food-production and educational facility. Each component of The Plant, from the bakery and beer brewery opening in 2012 to the community kitchens planned for 2013, will either reuse organic waste from other components, such as spent grain from the brewery to feed the tilapia, or provide fuel for the anaerobic digester, which converts organic waste into gas used to heat and power the building.The students continue to expand the farm and test the existing components, adding mushroom farming in fall 2011, experimenting with growing systems, and exploring the possibility of growing algae for medical use in the tilapia farm. Many students have continued to volunteer and work at The Plant well beyond the involvement required for their IPRO projects.The Plant is a farm like no other, incorporating complementary food-production facilities such as a beer brewery and kombucha tea maker. Every component of the facility uses waste that the other components produce, creating a closed system that provides its own power, uses all of its own waste, and produces a variety of food and beverages for consumers, restaurants, and markets.The anaerobic digester uses bacteria to turn organic waste into gas used to power the turbine generator, which provides power and heat for the building. In addition, hydroponic garden plants will consume carbon dioxide that the generator produces. The digestate byproduct of anaerobic digestion is, in turn, used as high-nitrogen fertilizer for outdoor growing operations.A beer brewer and kombucha tea maker are currently building facilities at The Plant. The spent grain from the beer brewing process will feed the fish and provide fuel for the anaerobic digester. Oxygen that the garden crops produce will be used in brewing tea, and the gardens will consume carbon dioxide produced during the brewing process. Waste from a commercial kitchen at the facility will also go to the anaerobic digester.The hydroponic gardens produce crops such as kale, lettuce, basil, and watercress, and mushrooms will be grown in spent grain from the brewery. The tilapia fish farm will grow to eventually allow sale of mature fish on the market. Fish waste provides fertilizer for the crops while the garden cleans the water in tanks housing the fish. Additional fish and garden waste provide organic fuel for the anaerobic digester.The Plant:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2012/its-bird-its-plane-its-flying-robot", "content": "Flying over obstacles that life can hurl your way is an enviable ability of superheroes, extra-terrestrials, and now\u2014IIT's rolling and flying robot.Assistant Professor Matthew Spenko and doctoral student Arash Kalantari of IIT Armour College of Engineering developed the 'bot, known as the hybrid terrestrial and aerial quadrotor (HyTAQ), as part of aproject. The goal of the project was to create a micro aerial vehicle capable of perching and moving on vertical surfaces composed of various types of materials, such as drywall, brick, or glass. The HyTAQ's capabilities on land and air coupled with its low weight make the robot one cool intermediary step toward that end.\"Creating multi-functionality in robots is difficult without adding lots of different actuators [motors] to the system,\" says Spenko from his Main Campus office, a heap of robot innards on the floor in front of his desk. \"I tasked Arash with creating locomotion in multiple domains without adding more actuators, which would be a big problem for both flying and controlling such a complex system. The type of actuators needed for flying are very different from those used for ground locomotion. In flying, you need high-speed actuators for generating lots of thrust; on the ground, you need low-speed and high-torque actuators.\"Kalantari tackled the problem in two parts. He first designed an aerial 'bot with four rotors, hence the quadrotor, and came up with a system that allows the robot to move on the ground using the same four actuators it uses for flying. Kalantari's first prototype was a, which won him thefor the month of June.After working out some efficiency issues with that system, Kalantari came up with the idea of floating the quadrotor in the middle of a crash-proof polycarbonate/carbon-fiber cylindrical cage on a pair of revolute joints, using the propulsion from the actuators to roll across the ground. Except for some of the electronics, Kalantari fabricated nearly every part of the HyTAQ in Spenko's.\"The beauty of all this is that Arash's solution is really elegant,\" Spenko says. \"The robot's a ground vehicle where obstacle-negotiation becomes a moot point. You can just fly it right over the problem, which is a big issue with ground robots. And it's an aerial vehicle that solves one of the biggest problems of aerial systems, especially quadrotors\u2014that they are highly inefficient.\"In the first phase of testing, the HyTAQ flew continuously for five minutes and traveled 600 meters in that time. On a smooth linoleum floor, the 'bot traveled for 27 minutes and covered 2,400 meters.

He fabricated his first puzzle by hand the summer before he began high school at Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in west suburban Aurora. It was a 3x3x5 twisty puzzle\u2014a functional, extended version of the legendary 3x3x3.Even though he had solved twisty puzzles up to the 5x5x5 level, Christianson says that the 3x3x5 was a technical challenge to both build and solve. He sold the 3x3x5 puzzle on eBay for about $100. That piece was a dress rehearsal for the X-Cube, which Christianson worked on during his first sophomore semester. He assembled the \"X\" configuration by extending additional puzzle layers on four faces of a 3x3x3 and in so doing, significantly increased its degree of difficulty. While many individuals resort to a series of memorized steps, or algorithms, to solve twisty puzzles, the X-Cube could provide puzzle fans with hours, days, or perhaps years of perplexing fun.

He recalls that co-founder Andy Grove often stood at Intel's main entrance clocking employees and that it was common to see Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Larry Ellison in the company cafeteria sharing doughnuts and discussion. It was a time when many people believed computing was reserved for helping businesses improve productivity and calculating the bottom line\u2014not for households or personal communication.\"But I felt like a participant and witness to the building of a new world, one that we now live in and kind of take for granted,\" he says. Chandrasekhar's initials appear on every 486 processor ever manufactured, and one of his treasured keepsakes is the first 486 fabricated chip that went into production, signed by all members of his design group.Infused with an entrepreneurial spirit from his time at Intel, Chandrasekhar returned to India in 1991. He got married and joined his father-in-law's company, BPL Group, and hoped to expand its reach by investing in the country's fledgling private telecom sector. He admits he was totally na\u00efve about the industry and remained steadfast in the face of naysayers who proclaimed mobile phones \"complete nonsense\" and a luxury reserved only for India's rich. By 2001, BPL Mobile was one of the largest cellular operators in India.Facing increasingly restrictive regulatory challenges, Chandrasekhar says he simply didn't wish to run a business anymore and sold the holding company, BPL Communications, four years later for $1.2 billion. He used some of the proceeds to take what he saw as the next logical step for an admitted risk-taker: the founding of Jupiter Capital, a venture development, management, and investment company.\"Jupiter has a fairly significant technology portfolio but not in the usual areas, such as Indian information technology or the Internet,\" he says. \"We instead select areas that are high-value and niche-oriented, such as aerospace and space aviation technology, that require significant amounts of specialized competency and knowledge.

But his political persona seems to be defined by the brash rapper Eminem\u2014whose song lyrics provide him with a favorite motto, \"I am not afraid to take a stand.\" It is tempered, however, by the influence of his father, a career Indian Air Force pilot, who imbued in his son a service mindset. Chandrasekhar's dark eyes can appear steely when posing any of the more than 700 questions he has raised before Parliament and warm in a photo documenting his family's role as foster caretakers of the animals of Bannerghatta National Park. His opinions, however, remain unchanged no matter what the political focus.\"My experiences in politics and public life have been very different from what the conventional wisdom is, that everybody is a crook and that nobody gives a fig about serving their communities, states, or the country,\" he says, in his characteristic outspoken manner. \"I'm out there and available to people, to challenge and to be challenged.

On his website, he regularly connects with citizens through Tweets and blogs about his key issues: Bangalore and Karnataka, governance reforms, the national security and welfare of armed forces personnel, and public assets and revenues.

Spinning disks are affordable and have a lot of capacity, but they are not compact, generate heat, and are prone to failure.\"Besides having persistent-storage capability in hard-disk drives, a supercomputer has volatile memory chips on each compute node; tens of thousands of these compute nodes connected together make up a supercomputer.

The compute nodes exchange information across a shared, internal communications network that has become increasingly congested and slow, given exponential growth in processing capacity and the complexity of problems supercomputers are tasked with undertaking.Supercomputers store data on external parallel file systems that also require communicating across a network. Being able to store the massive number of calculations exascale computers will perform in dedicated compute-node storage will result in a more high-performance and efficient system. There are currently no storage systems available that will scale to the sheer number of computers used in future exascale systems.Anticipated to be 1,000 times more powerful than China's, the world's fastest computer, exascale supercomputers will be capable of performing a wide variety of technological and scientific projects\u2014from the modeling and simulation of safe nuclear reactors to global-climate patterns.

SED '11), learned about the program while she was a graduate student at IIT and successfully led a group of fifth-grade Skinner students in their efforts to send an experiment about goldfish development to space last year.The sixth-graders' 2012 proposal\u2014\"Shmooing Around in Space\"\u2014was one of more than 1,100 finalist entries from a nine-state region. A team of scientists, engineers, and science educators from across the United States selected the proposal as among 11 experiments to go to space.David Stone, a yeast biologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, met with the six students who crafted the proposal over the spring and summer. He demonstrated how normal yeast shmoos form in response to pheromonal secretion, and practiced group skills for setting up the space experiment and loading the yeast into the NASA apparatus\u2014a Teflon outer tube with two inner glass tubes. In the experiment, an astronaut breaks one of the glass tubes mixing dormant yeast cells with a medium containing the pheromone, while leaving the cells in the other tube unmixed with the pheromone as a control.\"When students come to a real lab to work with a real scientist doing a real experiment, there is no substitute for the experience; it comes to life for them,\" says Stone. \"Kids are extremely curious about the natural world. We have to nourish that curiosity and show them how real science works.\"IIT Professor Christopher White, chair of the Department of Physics, served as a local judge and, according to Milroy, is one of two influential teachers who stoked her passion for making science come alive for young students.\"The U.S. economy and quality of life that we enjoy is dependent on high-quality STEM education. It's vital that we get our kids excited about science and technology, and find ways to keep them excited throughout their lives,\" says White. \"What Kori is doing is amazing, and her dedication to her students inspires me to do the same for mine.\"Milroy, a mother of two preschoolers, says what she wants for her children is what she is trying to impress upon her Skinner students.\"I want them to grow up with the power of being able to answer their own questions,\" she says. \"I love the fact that their ability to view science as a process changes their way of thinking. It gives them a new way of looking at the world, perhaps answering questions that have never before been answered.\"Sixth-grader Josh Tabuena says he \"really likes science because it's interesting to know more about the world around you,\" while fellow shmoo-mate Stone Chen recognizes the reach of science.\"Lots of different jobs refer to science\u2014math is also a part of everything, just like science is,\" explains Chen. \"I would like science to be a standing structure in my life.\"The students are anticipating the outcome of their efforts, when a Russian Soyuz spacecraft will bring their yeast experiment back to Earth for analysis, landing in Kazakhstan in November. No matter what the Skinner students discover, their experience will remain with them throughout their future science education.\"We ought to be able to immerse upper-elementary school students in every facet of real research, and stand back and be amazed; that's exactly what we're seeing,\" says Jeff Goldstein, director of the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education and SSEP creator. \"What we would like are students who are prepared to come in as explorers, critical thinkers, and individuals who are at ease integrating across disciplines so that universities have that kind of skill set in their students as soon as they walk through the door.\"National Center for Earth and Space Science Education:Student Spaceflight Experiments Program:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2012/op-ed-stem-education-and-iit-engineering-themes", "content": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) initiatives affect more than the K\u201312 education system. Science- and engineering-focused universities such as Illinois Institute of Technology are strongly invested in seeing these initiatives succeed.In February 2012, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) reported that K\u201312 STEM preparation is so deficient that colleges and universities are spending at least $2 billion per year to help students compensate for knowledge gaps in STEM fields.In response to this report, President Obama announced the $1 billion Master Teacher Corps, which provides stipends as incentives for high-performing K\u201312 STEM teachers. The goal is to create a strong network of excellent teachers who will raise the quality of STEM education.Still, change in educational systems and culture is a slow process. The Master Teacher Corps will start small\u2014with 50 top teachers\u2014and expand to 10,000 over four years, relying on a multiplier effect to accelerate change.We cannot afford to have change materialize slowly. We must take steps to immediately address deficiencies to ensure that the current graduating class benefits from the double-digit job growth projected for STEM fields by 2018.As a small, private university, IIT is uniquely situated to address the knowledge gap. Our engineering programs are strong, yet nimble, enabling students to overcome inadequacies in STEM education through new initiatives such as the IIT Engineering Themes.The IIT Engineering Themes are an optional set of enrichment experiences that help undergraduates impact worldwide engineering issues while completing an accredited degree in their chosen field\u2014without modifying their degree plan.These four themes were chosen because they are interrelated, pose several engineering challenges, and are areas in which engineers can influence the entire global population.The best way to educate engineers is to put them to work both in and outside the classroom. This allows students to contextualize and apply their knowledge, personally connect to the problem, and improve learning and creative processes. Hands-on experiences inspire peer-to-peer learning and empower students to recognize issues and propose solutions in a collaborative way.We also expose our students to engineers who are working in today's economy\u2014which favors lean, multidisciplinary organizations. Gone are the days of inflated, one-dimensional teams. The themes highlight and capitalize on this as a learning opportunity.In its report, PCAST also noted that fewer than 40 percent of students who enter college to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree. Uninspiring introductory courses are largely to blame.Our alternative approach engages students through team-intensive engineering projects, field work, site visits, meaningful engineering internships, forums, career panels, and competitions.As students progress through the Themes program, the IIT Engineering Themes Portfolio tracks their progress and creates an entry for each experience. The end product is four years of work packaged digitally with photos, videos, personalized write-ups, and online information about the tangible experience students gained as IIT engineering undergraduates. This portfolio will greatly increase students' marketability as they transition into a STEM profession or graduate school.We not only keep our students engaged, we help them stand out. And while our country is working to broadly reform STEM education for future generations, our small institution is changing the way this class of students is educated.

Their five-year project, funded by the National Institutes of Health, will allow 25\u201335 fourth-year students in Kang-Mieler's two-semester capstone BME course to work on biomedical innovations to increase safety.\"People assume that very sophisticated technology in the OR means that safety has improved, but that is not always the case,\" Kang-Mieler says. \"We really have to look at the culture in the OR.\" To do this, she has teamed up with fellow BME Associate Professor Derek Kamper and John White, chair of the Department of Surgery of Advocate Lutheran General Hospital.\"Improvement in patient safety requires redesigning the operating room to support and enhance all aspects of the surgical procedure,\" White says. \"These advances will come only through bright minds trained in analyzing processes, such as biomedical engineers.\"Under the new grant, the students will analyze the complete OR environment, interacting with the surgeons as well as with the complex network of nurses and support staff. Students will apply user-centered design techniques in which a constant dialog between bioengineers and end users helps fine tune resulting innovations.One of many OR practices student teams have sought to improve is the meticulous counting of surgical tools and gauze required before and after operations, to prevent such foreign objects being left in patients\u2014an ongoing safety issue that affects roughly one in every 1,500 intra-abdominal surgeries.\"Every year we have great ideas coming out of these students,\" Kang-Mieler says. \"We'd really like to take some of these to the next level by encouraging students to apply for patents and explore commercial possibilities.\"Students studying under Jennifer Kang-Mieler are applying their work beyond the OR.

A former Student Government Association president, he was honored with the Richard Babcock Award for outstanding student leadership, the Clinton E. Stryker Award for significant contributions to the IIT community, and the Neal L. Hospers Award from Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity for Most Outstanding Undergraduate. As Tenenbaum advanced in his coursework, his desire to one day work in the space industry skyrocketed as well.Five years after graduating from IIT Armour College of Engineering, he continues to expand his aerospace frontiers at SpaceX, a private company that designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. With a goal to one day make it possible for people to live on other planets, SpaceX was recently awarded $440 million from NASA to develop the successor to the space shuttle and extend the reach of solar system exploration.I first became interested in space after watching the movie Apollo 13 and seeing how the NASA mission control team was able to come together, solve a really difficult problem, and bring home the Apollo 13 astronauts. I couldn't imagine working on something more exciting and challenging than space exploration. That's what really sparked my interest in space and becoming an aerospace engineer.One of my favorite things about being a part of SpaceX is that every day brings something different. Over the last two years, I've been fortunate to be able to work hands-on with our spacecraft\u2014from design, integration, and testing of the vehicle through launch and real-time operations. Designing and building a spacecraft to berth with the International Space Station (ISS) involves a lot of coordination with NASA on both the vehicle design and testing to ensure that we meet the safety requirements NASA has for visiting vehicles. For me, that's meant working with NASA to show we meet all of their requirements, coordinating the joint testing we do in conjunction with NASA, planning the overall integration and testing needed to get Dragon ready for flight, and then actually performing the testing and hardware integration on the spacecraft. There are days when I'm in meetings with NASA in the morning, writing and testing ground software we use to operate the spacecraft in the afternoon, and running a test on the spacecraft or participating in a mission simulation in the evening.When I applied to SpaceX, I was interested in working on Dragon. I was brought on to help lead the verification and integration activities between SpaceX and NASA, which was a good fit with my previous experience doing similar work with NASA on Orion. [Before joining SpaceX, Tenenbaum worked for three years at Lockheed Martin on the Orion spacecraft.] Now that we've had our first flight to the ISS, our focus for Dragon moves from development to production and making all of our operations more efficient. With the NASA contract, we will upgrade our cargo Dragon vehicle to carry NASA astronauts to the ISS, which is what we had in mind when designing Dragon. For our crewed Dragon vehicle, I'm working on the development of the next-generation space suits astronauts will need for the trip to the ISS.That's a tough question; almost every day brings a different challenge. We've worked really closely with NASA on the development of Dragon and have learned a lot during that partnership. We're constantly working to meet NASA's requirements, and often, that involves proposing new approaches to solve a problem. Working this way has ultimately yielded some great results; the partnership has not only helped us develop a better spacecraft, but it's also caused NASA to consider new ways to approach problems.I couldn't ask to be in a more exciting place in the space industry right now. It's a huge challenge to develop a brand new spacecraft, complete all of the rigorous testing and analysis required by NASA, and then not only fly it to the space station but also return it back to Earth. The team at SpaceX that made this a reality is a phenomenal group of people, and I feel really lucky to be a part of it.SpaceX:NASA:"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2012/new-membrane-research-takes-shape", "content": "This year's International AIDS Conference outlined ambitious global treatment goals with the potential to save millions of lives. On the downside, however, participants reported disappointingly slow progress toward an effective vaccine against HIV.According to David Gidalevitz, IIT associate professor of physics, a more fundamental understanding of cell membranes\u2014the port of entry for HIV and other pathogens\u2014may eventually break this deadlock. His research into the nature of biological membranes, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, is providing important new insights into these dynamic structures.\"In living cells, we see curvature everywhere,\" Gidalevitz says, noting that it occurs not only on the cell's surface, but in internal structures. \"But what is the mechanism of this curvature? That's a very interesting question.\"The new paper examines the role of cholesterol in directing cell membrane curvature in the presence of gp41\u2014a key HIV fusion protein, which acts like a molecular harpoon, piercing the cell membrane and initiating HIV infection.To study membrane behavior, Gidalevitz created an artificial monolayer\u2014a thin film of lipids (including cholesterol)\u2014on the surface of water. The advantage of this model membrane is that it permits extremely fine control over the process. \"We can determine the amount of molecules at the water interface to a very high degree,\" he says.While it has long been known that proteins can affect the curvature of the cell membranes with which they interact, the new study demonstrated for the first time that cholesterol concentration also affects protein shape.In the case of gp41, the presence of cholesterol causes the protein to assume one of two conformational forms\u2014alpha helix (when cholesterol is low) or beta sheet (when it is high), which also changes how deeply the HIV protein penetrates the cell membrane.Gidalevitz believes that understanding the subtleties of membrane-protein interaction is an essential piece of the HIV puzzle and will ultimately assist efforts to outwit the virus.Driving Membrane Curvature: www.aps.anl.gov/Science/Highlights/Content/APS_SCIENCE_20120613.php"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2012/more-pretty-face", "content": "The tomato has come a long way since the days of colonial America, when it was dubbed a deadly nightshade and relegated to the world of ornamentals. Fortunately, this was a short-lived, regional blip in the life of the rotund fruit, which has since been considered a healthy food.A new study at IIT's Institute for Food Safety and Health (IFSH) goes one step further, finding that the tomato is not only health-promoting but can weaken the harmful effects of a high-fat diet. Tomatoes contain lycopene, a pigment compound in food known for its antioxidant qualities. Based on its earlier research of strawberries, another source of antioxidants, the team hypothesized that the tomatoes must be consumed as part of a meal in order to have a lasting, protective effect following a high-fat meal\u2014when cell damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation occur in the body.IFSH researchers studied 25 healthy adults, supplementing high-fat meals with standard portions of tomato paste, a concentrated form of lycopene. The study, published in the April 2012 volume of the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, demonstrated that consuming tomatoes as part of a high-fat meal blocked a rise in harmful oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and inflammation; this may reduce the risk of developing heart disease. The study also supported earlier research that the consumption of antioxidants enables the body to maintain appropriate levels of insulin, required to maintain proper blood sugar.\"Oxidative stress and inflammation are tightly linked and associated with many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes,\" says a principal researcher on the team, Indika Edirisinghe, research assistant professor and senior scientist with the Center for Nutrition Research at IFSH. He and his team also completed similar lycopene research with overweight/obese subjects and found significant beneficial effects.Edirisinghe adds, \"Addressing daily and meal-to-meal 'insults' to maintain system balance may be an important strategy for reducing chronic illness.\"\u2014With reporting by Elyse Doll (PSYC 4th Year)"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2017/letters", "content": "IIT MagazineThe class was on the top floor, and in addition to the coal smoke, the building shook whenever a train rushed by.

He also brings plenty of rock-star vibe, gliding around campus in a black Mercedes with a \"Howie T\" vanity plate and casting a bold vision for the Kaplan Institute's future. We asked him what drew him to Illinois Tech and about his plans for the Kaplan Institute.Two, this particular learning environment is a lot different than 1871 in terms of the focus and the stakes. At 1871, I felt like, if you were a kid from a northern suburb and your parents didn't have anything better to do with you, they'd send you down to fool around for a year trying to invent a pet-dating site. At Illinois Tech you're here to get a real set of skills that will turn into a real job. The idea behind the Kaplan Institute is to bolt entrepreneurship training and innovation-technology skills onto a set of technical skills, to really make you a more complete and valuable employee.From day one, I said that the Kaplan Institute can't just be the student union for techies. There are plenty of those. And I think that's a risk; most universities that have incubators are not sufficiently focused on turning out talented and qualified students who can hit the ground running and immediately help their employers. We don't do [our students] much long-term good if we give them this wonderful education in a vacuum. If I can't give you the skills you need for tomorrow and if I can't get you a serious job upon graduation so that you can support yourself and repay your student debt, then we haven't prepared you and fully equipped you with the skills you're going to require not simply for graduation but to go on and build a successful future.Over time, businesses become the behaviors they tolerate. If we start out at Kaplan and say, \"Everybody can do whatever they please and you can have piles of scraps and material spread out everywhere,\" then you'll end up with a mess that sends the wrong message to everyone\u2014students, faculty, supporters and donors, and especially employers. That's not going to be how it is at KI. Order, organization, control, and discipline are all components of being proud of what you're doing and paying attention to the details, and it's absolutely contagious.

And the Kaplan Institute has been designed to inspire students to work on projects like this,\" says Robison of the summer IPRO course, adding that faculty basically only set deadlines and provided feedback.Tayseer Mozaffar (EMGT 4th year), whose team designed a fire risk self-assessment tool in the ARC course, says that it was very satisfying to know that this project is helping ARC reduce fires and alleviate human suffering.\"I love working on real-life problems. You don't get the chance too often in a classroom setting to help a nonprofit organization develop tools to reduce real fires affecting real people,\" Mozaffar explains. \"I'm impressed by how much we did and am happy with what we accomplished. In my opinion, there's no more valuable a class than an IPRO.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2018/built-barcode", "content": "It's 90 degrees on a late June day as Edward L. \"Ed\" Kaplan (ME '65) bounds into IIT Tower dressed in navy walking shorts, a navy plaid polo shirt, and fluorescent yellow athletic shoes. While his chronological age may be 75, his spirit and enthusiasm appear to be no less diminished than when he was a 26-year-old entrepreneur who, along with the late Gerhard \"Gary\" Cless, began to fabricate the machines and processes that would eventually form Zebra Technologies Corporation, a pioneering asset-identification company that earned $3.72 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2017.Too hyped up to even take a seat inside the cool conference room where we meet, Kaplan stands and provides a quick object lesson on a 500-milliliter plastic bottle of purified drinking water. He turns the bottle on its side and points to the black-and-white strip of lines and numbers\u2014the barcode\u2014that, in a sense, comprises the cornerstone of the Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship.\"We had an entry product that was better, in some ways, than other printers that were in the marketplace,\" recalls Kaplan about the duo's first barcode printer, the MODUPRINT. \"But we didn't stop there. We went into what was called thermal transfer and a revolutionary printing technology that moved Zebra Technologies into the industry leader position. The MODUPRINT could print this,\" Kaplan says, gesturing to the bottle's barcode. \"But it couldn't print it as well or as fast or for the same price as the Z-130,\" he adds, acknowledging the thermal transfer device that moved the company into the top tier.Kaplan's gaze shifts out the window 17 floors up and over an unobstructed view of Mies Campus to the north.\"I'm just a lucky guy who made some money, and that money is now invested in that white building and in the people who are going to be in that white building,\" he says, nodding his head in the direction of the ethylene tetrafluoroethylene-paneled Kaplan Institute. \"Universities could be about a lot of different things, but to me, the reason we're building that institute is because we want toto\u2014by themselves or in collaboration with others\u2014build a business, learning what it takes to go down that road.\"A few years before he retired in 2007 from the company that he co-founded, Kaplan prepared a thick binder's worth of presentations that he wrote\u2014what he calls \"Zebra's vision and guiding principles\"\u2014for management and other interested groups. Equal parts historical overview and business wisdom, the binder emphasizes theinvolved in the evolution of building a successful company\u2014from the staff and the suppliers to the customers. With his attention now focused on Illinois Tech's students, Kaplan shares 10 pivotal moments\u2014both high and low\u2014in the history of Zebra Technologies that may serve them as guideposts of innovation and tech entrepreneurship.A 26-year-old Ed Kaplan [left, in photo below], along with Teletype Corporation colleague (the late) Gerhard \"Gary\" Cless, form a part-time business\u2014Data Specialties (DSI)\u2014to design electromechanical equipment and \"have some fun,\" says Kaplan.A client places an order for 500 data recorders. (A cash register sent transactions to the recorder, which encoded the data in the form of punched holes in a one-inch-wide paper tape.) Kaplan and Cless secure a one-time $10,000 bank loan and then return to the bank to plead for a second $10,000 loan to complete the job. After the duo purchases 200 sets of custom parts and delivers 25 data recorders, the client cancels the remaining job. \"We were left with 175 sets of unique parts\u2014nobody else could really use them,\" says Kaplan. \"This was a big problem for two young kids. What do we do with the parts and what do we do when we can't pay our bills?\" Their problems only increase. The duo places ads in trade publications to drum up business and receives an order from Florida for 1,000 teller terminal printers. After DSI delivers two prototypes, that client serves the company with a bogus lawsuit claiming that it showed drawings and prototypes to a competitor.Kaplan and Cless, who left their full-time jobs in 1970, borrow money from family and friends to launch a full-throttle sales campaign. They create the PMR-820 paper- tape perforator from the scrapped parts, and this decision enables their first real success.The duo designs and constructs the MODUPERF modular paper-tape punch, an industry first. The device is billed as \"The Ultimate in Design Simplicity.\"DSI introduces a product new to the barcode world with the MODUPRINT, a matrix label printer that features eight different barcode symbologies in 37 sizes.Kaplan and Cless earn their stripes and change the name of their company to Zebra Technologies Corporation. They enter the upper echelons of the barcode industry with their introduction of the Z-130, a thermal transfer printer for on-demand barcode labeling.The privately held Zebra Technologies makes an initial public offering in 1991 and raises $40 million.Zebra Technologies merges with Eltron International, a provider of desktop and photo ID card printers for items such as driver's licenses and access cards. Two years later, Comtec Information Systems, a leading provider of wireless mobile printers, joins Zebra.The acquisitions enable Zebra Technologies to extend the barcode printer range and also add desktop printer competencies and products.Kaplan retires after 37 years as Zebra's chairman and chief executive officer to head Nalpak, Inc., a private investment firm.Zebra Technologies acquires Motorola Solutions\u2013Enterprise Business."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/issues", "content": ""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/alumni-awards-2017", "content": "Adrian R.

Both of his parents, Ernest (ARCH '61) and Marilyn (ARCH '67), attended Illinois Tech, and as they tried to point him in what they thought was the right direction, he played the part of the brooding teenager looking to rebel.Finally, he agreed to take a tour of campus just to appease them, and as he was moping in the back of the tour group a current student called him out on his behavior.\"This student from the Institute of Design was sitting on the Crown Hall steps, and she asked me why I was looking like a sullen two-year-old,\" he says. \"I told her I was only there because of my parents, and she told me about an audio lab she was setting up in the basement of Crown, where they were recording sounds in the city and analyzing them in the lab to see if they could elicit human behavior based on the sounds.

To become thinkers who not only trust their intuitions, but act on them. To become entrepreneurs who get out of their comfort zones to take a leap.\"What really matters is trying to push your boundaries,\" says Tiger Safarov (AE '10), founder of ZenSupplies, who tells students to use their time at Illinois Tech as their \"personal experience lab.\"\"Try to tell someone, 'Let's go have a beer, or let's go for a run.' See how much you can talk to people,\" he says. \"That's the learning experience.\"These four alumni entrepreneurs did just that, taking their experience in construction management, architecture, design, and computer science and turning it into products, software, and services that not only have found their niche markets but have done so with a grounding in their founders' life philosophies.Smart phones were developed to help us master our lives by becoming more connected, but often they do just the opposite when we are slaves to notifications and social media, becoming more disconnected from the physical world around us.That notion irked Kaiwei Tang when he joined a Google-run incubator not long after receiving his degree. While there, he was encouraged to create new mobile phone apps, which he knew would only perpetuate the addiction cycle.After meeting fellow incubator resident Joe Hollier, the two decided to do the opposite: create technology that encouraged people to take a break.Together they created, a white, credit-card-sized phone designed to only make and receive calls. It is a secondary phone that users can take when they're on a walk or spending time with family and friends. Tang calls it \"going light.\" After launching in 2016, the company sold 11,000 phones. Feedback was positive, but several users just wanted \"one more feature.\" The founders collected these suggestions and developed Light Phone 2, which includes more features, including messaging and an alarm clock\u2014but still no social media or news. That phone will ship early next year.\"When someone says, 'Hey, I'm going light,' it almost becomes a lifestyle,\" Tang says. \"I'm hoping Light Phone will encourage more people to live in the moment.\"For Fariha Wajid, a design isn't just about creating something pleasing to the eye\u2014it's about translating the story behind it.Wajid translates her memories, photographs, and sketches from her travels\u2014the waves of a Wisconsin river, the geometric patterns of an Irani building\u2014into woodblock-printed scarves and stationary, which she sells through her startup. When customers order her handmade goods online or buy them in stores, they also receive a card that tells the story or experience that inspired the item's design.\"I really enjoy selling at craft markets, because people ask how I came up with the patterns, and there is a conversation, and that makes the product unique,\" she says.The idea for the business began at Illinois Tech\u2014she learned to woodblock print through a class, then developed a business plan through an entrepreneurship course\u2014but it took a while before she was ready to make the leap to full-time entrepreneur. In fact, for most of her life she was set on becoming an architect.\"Once I founded INKMADE, it just happened, and I put time and money into it, and I thought, am I actually going to earn it back or is this just a foggy dream?\" she said.It wasn't: Wajid is now working on getting her designs into more craft markets and into larger boutiques and pop-up stores.\"I'm an immigrant, so to me it's easy. Not because we think differently. Sometimes you don't have a choice.\"Tiger Safarov wasn't looking to start a business while studying engineering at Illinois Tech, but in 2007, two years after he emigrated to the United States from Russia, he couldn't persuade any construction companies to hire him.After taking a construction estimating course, he approached his former college and offered an estimate to turn a basement room into a classroom. He won the job, despite having no formal company or any contractors. He quickly organized a company, Siegel Construction, and convinced contractors to buy materials on their own dime. They finished the job on time.\"I made $3,000 on the job, and I thought, this is it. This is my way to becoming the richest person on the planet Earth,\" he says.He eventually won a job constructing a medical office in the suburbs of Chicago, where two women walking by stopped and said they were impressed by the cleanliness of the work site. That serendipitous connection led to a job constructing a dental office, which led to another, and another. Soon the company was only constructing dental offices.Safarov sold the company in 2014, but realized that, after talking with dentists, many offices had inventory problems. His next venture was developing software for dental practices to order supplies and keep track of inventory.began in 2016 and already has more than 350 clients.\"What I'm doing now is freedom,\" he says. \"I get to the office, and nobody tells me what to do or how to do it, and I think that's the ultimate dream.\"School fundraisers are no longer about selling cookies and wrapping paper.But while the digital era of school fundraising allows teachers to easily set up their own fundraising websites to raise money for supplies, events, and infrastructure, Alex Allen found that administrators wanted more oversight and control over these crowdfunding ventures.Enter, fundraising management software for schools that allows districts to approve and track fundraisers, including both online donation campaigns and in-person events. Allen founded the company three years ago with several other Illinois Tech alumni and works as the company's chief technology officer, developing the software and ensuring it can scale up as the company takes on more clients.\"What I learned at IIT was how to integrate complex systems and think holistically,\" he says. \"Learning how to learn is the most important thing, because in a field like technology, there are always so many new frameworks and languages and practices.\"The company has clients throughout Wisconsin and is looking to expand throughout the Midwest.

Many corporations make outsourcing services available as part of severance. Use them. Counselors can help you organize, identify and prioritize tasks prior to preparing a strategy. If retraining programs are included, seek advice in selecting what is best for you. Timing dictates all, but you want to be the one considered for opportunities when they surface.

Basically, they are either contract (Manpower, CDI, Superior) or direct placement. Most are general practitioners, specializing in a range of disciplines across all industries and markets. A few, like the Search Team, specialize in an industry sector. Your selection of a recruiter should use the same parameters as employers. The biggest complaints from employers are that the majority of recruiters are not hands-on professionals in the disciplines or industries they represent, are not familiar with the nuances of these jobs or the processes, and submit inappropriate candidates based on seeing only key words or phrases. Successful recruiters know the positions and the players, share much in common with job seekers by truly understanding their needs and wants, and are not just processing paper by matching industry buzz terms.Remember: you are your own primary resource.

With anticipation, Osmer and her family searched for NASA's International Space Station\u2014a small, bright light traveling across the starry night. Osmer's mother, Diane, had helped to develop the software that determined the orientation of the station's solar panels.\"We always kept track of the space station,\" says Osmer. \"Looking up and seeing it in the sky, I knew my mom had a hand in that work, and I knew there was potential for me to do something like that.\"Osmer, now a component product engineer (CPE), is her mother's co-worker atin Chatsworth, California. The world-recognized aerospace and defense leader provides propulsion and energetics to the space, missile defense and strategic systems, and tactical systems and armaments areas.\"The space industry is growing and there are exciting technology advancements being made,\" says Diane Osmer. \"I am thrilled thatis pursuing a career in the space industry.\"Even as a child, Osmer wasn't satisfied with only looking up. After seeing the Blue Angels perform in an airshow when she was in the eighth grade, she decided she wanted to be a United States Navy pilot. After high school she enrolled inon an ROTC scholarship.Although a number of pilot program requirements, as well as Osmer's unmet expectations, eventually grounded her plans to join the Navy, the CPE position at Aerojet Rocketdyne became available after Osmer's graduation. While her mother has always worked in software, Osmer says her own work involves \"the building-things side\" of hardware.\"At some point, we envision having people onsite in places like Mars, but we have to ensure their safety.\"\u2014Leana Osmer (AE' 16)Building things had been instilled in Osmer at a young age. As much as her mother inspired her to look up, Osmer's father, Harold, insisted she \"look beyond her nose.\" Osmer explains that her father built a woodworking shop in their backyard for the sole purpose of teaching Osmer and her sister to put aside their handheld video games and instead work with their hands.Today Osmer says that\u2014in simple terms\u2014she works on a rocket's \"plumbing,\" which involves the creation of small components to connect the large components, such as the lines that carry fluids from one side of a rocket's engine to another.She and her team are working on components for the newbooster engine, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engine, which will support the missions of NASA's 70-metric ton Space Launch System (SLS). The SLS is designed to send astronauts and cargo to explore the moon and other deep-space destinations. A cluster of four Aerojet Rocketdyne-built RS-25 engines will provide thrust for the launch vehicle's core stage. The thrust provided by the engines could keep eight Boeing 747s aloft.The process of designing and building the larger and more complex components of the rockets involves additive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing. Osmer says the importance of today's additive manufacturing is far reaching, and she hopes to have a hand in 3-D printing advances.\"At some point, we envision having people onsite in places like Mars, but we have to ensure their safety. Although data travels back and forth quickly, physical supplies take a long time to deliver,\" she says. \"NASA and the larger community see 3-D printing someday enabling us to use raw materials mined from deep space. We want to perfect the 3-D process, so we can hit print, and build and replace whatever part is needed.\"As Osmer takes part in imagining such a future, she is obviously a product of her past and the \"rare family dynamic\" of a stay-at-home dad and a mother in the aerospace engineering industry.\"I know there weren't many women in AE when mom started,\" Osmer says. \"Honestly, we haven't talked much about the differences between then and today.

'42), and Martin \"Marty\" Cooper (EE '50, M.S. '71).\"We can make power electronic converters behave like a combination of power plants, with each converter having the brain of a virtual synchronous machine,\" says Zhong, Max McGraw Endowed Chair of Energy and Power Engineering and Management, from his office in Illinois Tech's Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research. \"I know that my idea for a synchronized and democratized power grid could be adopted worldwide.\"Z. John Shen, Grainger Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, recruited Zhong to Armour College of Engineering after meeting him at a conference and hearing about the power electronic converter control system he began to both think about and develop at Imperial College London in 2001. At Illinois Tech, Zhong founded the startupand acquired new supporters, including David Baker, founding executive director of University Technology Park at Illinois Tech and now head of the tech consultancy Fremont St. Associates, and Jim MacInnes, engineer, chair of the Michigan Utility Consumer Participation Board, and chief executive officer and co-owner of Crystal Mountain resort, home to the first LEED-certified spa in the Midwest. MacInnes explains why Zhong's concept is crucial to existing power systems around the U.S. and other countries that use traditional grid technology.\"Massive synchronous machines in central station power plants have long relied on rotational inertia to provide grid stability; however, as large aging plants are being retired, millions of smaller and environmentally cleaner distributed energy resources (DER) such as wind generators, solar PV [photovoltaic] installations, battery storage, and other widely disbursed smaller generators are in the works to replace them,\" explains MacInnes, named a \"Michigan Green Leader\" by thein 2010.MacInnes explains that the grid will become increasingly unstable as more nonsynchronous alternative energy resources are added to it over the next 20\u201330 years.\"We need devices that can provide stability, which is why Dr. Zhong's work is so important. His invention will allow DERs to provide two of the most important grid stability services\u2014primary frequency control and voltage support\u2014autonomously and nearly instantaneously. It can turn almost any DER into a virtual synchronous machine capable of providing quick-acting grid regulation services.\"Zhong's \"synchronized and democratized\" (SYNDEM, in short) approach for smart grid integration has its philosophical roots in ancient China. Born in rural Sichuan province, Zhong says he was influenced by theand the history of his homeland, which was highly democratized some 2,300 years ago before becoming unified, and then characterized by increased stability and harmony. While he acknowledges that power systems are moving toward a decentralized \"democratic\" future, he posits that power systems should not only be democratized technically\u2014but also all power system players need synchronize their actions toward the common goal of stability of frequency and voltage, a harmonious outcome.Working in partnership with the the global connections he has made in academia and industry while promoting his idea, Zhong says that he is taking steps toward commercializing his power converter system. He also oversees a laboratory team of postdocs and graduate students who are helping to further refine and test the power converter system. Inspired perhaps by thequote \"When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everyone will respect you,\" he motions to a large paper scroll hanging on the wall above his computer station that he asked a Chinese calligrapher to prepare for him.\"It basically says that to get better every day, excel yourself,\" Zhong says. \"I never compare myself to others; I only compare myself to myself. Every day I make a little bit of progress, which adds up.

Though its deep impact is undeniable, the Internet has yet to prove that it can single-handedly change education. CEOs of online universities, for example, are not nearly as brash in their pronouncements as they were in the late 90s. No more do we hear quotes of how the brick and mortar classroom will be a memory in 20 years. In fact, as venture capital for online education ventures is being cut, many administrators in higher education are scaling back in their commitments to online learning.The successful approach of late seems to be a holistic one, where video and the World Wide Web are used to enhance a classroom, not replace it. This type of holistic approach is a lot easier to pull off if you didn't join the high-tech bandwagon in the 1990s and place a large bet on a future higher education landscape that would be dominated by technology-based distance learning.This holistic approach is how Illinois Institute of Technology is treating its e-learning programs. IIT began offering courses at a distance using microwave to sites within the Chicago area in 1976., which put its first class on the Internet in 1997, currently offers 62 Internet classes. Video and audio from the lecture is combined with an accompanying slide window which contains everything the professor writes on a blackboard as well as materials distributed to the class. \"Now students can focus on thinking about what the professor is saying and formulate questions and not worry about taking notes or writing down formulas,\" says Louise Hewitt, director of IIT Online Technical Services. And to supplement the classroom experience, professors can set up chat rooms or video conferencing. The approach is working\u2014enrollments online via the Internet almost doubled this past year.The complementary approach is working at other institutions as well. If it wasn't for an e-learning program at the, you can bet Dirk DiSantis of Johnson City, Tennessee, wouldn't be getting his MBA right now\u2014at least not if he wanted to stay happily married. \"My wife would clobber me if I tried to get an MBA the regular way,\" says DiSantis, whose wife, Susan, is expecting their third child this summer. \"Without the Internet, there's just no way time wise that I could swing it.\" In addition to juggling family and school responsibilities, the marketing specialist with Eastman Chemical spends plenty of time playing road warrior as he travels frequently for his company throughout the country.Clearly DiSantis is a bad fit for any program requiring lots of physical classroom time. But luckily for him, UT, Knoxville, offers a blended MBA program where students spend about 10 days every other month on campus. Between these residence periods, the school holds virtual classes and workshops online where students can ask questions and work on projects with each other via the Internet.A practical example of e-learning? Sure. But it's a comparatively mundane manifestation of the glorious \"classes for the masses\" vision that many colleges and universities promoted at the height of the late 1990s Internet frenzy. It was a vision driven by both greed and fear. Some schools fretted that Microsoft or some other tech powerhouse would launch an educational version ofand make brick-and-mortar-and-ivy colleges obsolete overnight. Other schools hoped e-learning programs would increase their market share and attract thousands of new students such as retirees wishing to take courses in Greek mythology or the Civil War. Perhaps these programs could even become wildly profitable separate ventures with public offerings.Yet just as Webzines found it tough to get people to pay for subscriptions, colleges found few takers for their liberal arts, learning-for-pleasure Internet fare. Now many of these institutions of higher learning, like many beleaguered Web companies, are refocusing their efforts and doing what they should have done right from the start; determine who in 2002 are really their potential customers, who actually needs to use e-learning and is willing to pay for it, and then figure out the best way of delivering their services to them.That process and the stark financial realities it has uncovered prompted many institutions to drop out.recently closed its e-learning company, NYU Online, while theclosed its for-profit online venture last October. Temple University's company, Virtual Temple, closed in the summer of 2001. \"These schools thought these companies were going to be growth vehicles for them and maybe even go public,\" says Greg Capelli, a Chicago-based e-learning analyst forFirst Boston. \"They spent millions, but it never happened.\"Those who have stuck it out have been forced to switch directions. Take Fathom, for instance. A for-profit venture started two year ago by\u2014and partnered with other institutions such as the,and the\u2014Fathom was supposed to bring in the big bucks by offering liberal arts courses online to so-called lifelong learners. Yet few signed up for these classes, such as a $670 semester-long course called \"Shakespeare to 1603\" about the earlier works of the Bard. \"When we were launched, we were heavily weighted toward these lifelong learners, but I think we underestimated their comfort level with the Internet\" says Anne Rollow, vice president of strategic alliances and marketing for Fathom. \"There is a hesitancy to pay unless you know exactly what you're getting.\"Fathom now allows users to experiment with shorter (10 weeks or so), less expensive ($45) e-courses such as \"The Shakespeare You Never Knew: The Early History Plays.\" Prospective students can also sign up for free two-hour seminars if they really want to ease into e-learning. More importantly, Fathom has belatedly realized that the most profitable market segment for e-learning is people who see furthering their education as a way of moving up the corporate ladder. In February, Fathom introduced a \"professional development\" section featuring more down-to-earth class selections such as \"Closing the Sale\" and \"Assert to Achieve.\" Rollow says that while \"personal enrichment\" learning may well be the future of the company, \"professional development is really where the growth is and we're tapping into it.\"Fathom has gotten at least part of the profit puzzle right. The $235 billion post-secondary education market, according to the U.S. Department of Education, is expected to grow at a six percent annual clip during the next five years. But the portion of the market comprising students who are 25 and older is expected to grow at nine percent per year\u2014and three-quarters of that group work while attending school. These are students, says Bear Stearns analyst Jennifer Childe, who \"seek education to update and improve their skills ... and enhance their earning potential.\"That is exactly the market sought by the University of Phoenix Online, one of e-learning's biggest success stories. It's the largest such program in the United States with nearly 34,000 students currently enrolled, having awarded nearly 10,000 online degrees. Enrollment is up 72 percent during the past four years. \"People talk about all the commercial failures, but online education has not been a failure,\" says Terri Hedegaard, senior vice president of distance learning for the University of Phoenix. \"There are programs at universities all over the country. They just haven't been wrapped up into a big, fat commercial venture.\" Indeed, more than 150 institutions offer undergraduate degrees online and nearly 200 offer graduate degrees.Another school making online education work is thewhich has more than 3,000 online students. Childe explains that the success of Maryland's and the Phoenix's programs shows that in addition to going after the right sort of student, e-learning programs \"must establish an educational brand name to compete effectively.\" She notes that pure e-learning firms such asandhave only 6,000 and 3,000 students, respectively, despite being around since the mid-1990s.An alternative e-learning approach is taken by, based in Deerfield, Illinois.

PPI taught corporate America how to more effectively use Microsoft, Lotus, Novell and other industry-standard PC software. Preheim served as CEO and chairman of the board until its purchase byin 1997, and over fourteen years the combined enterprise grew to more than $100 million in annual revenue. He served as a member of the Office of the President during PPI's transition to Knowledge Universe in 2000. On June 1, 2002, Preheim replacedas the seventh dean of IIT's business school. Hassan stepped down as dean and was designated dean emeritus. He will be staying on as a member of the faculty and playing an important role in Dean Preheim's management team.Preheim's early goal is to define the mission of the business school in this time of transition. His vision going forward calls for Stuart to focus on the three concepts of quality, responsiveness and innovation.First, quality and a philosophy of continuous improvement will be even more of a standard practice at Stuart, with a major focus on being able to bridge the gap between the theoretical constructs taught by Stuart's full-time faculty, and the real-world business experience of the practicing part-time faculty.As to responsiveness, Stuart's academic calendar and curriculum will be even more adaptable to meet the needs of today's students in the marketplace more quickly (referred to traditionally as \"cycle time\").Finally, innovation is key because of the need for Stuart to find an appropriately differentiated niche among business schools. Preheim expects that Stuart's faculty and management team will iron out this new direction for the school and implement the new vision quickly.So why would someone with a career based on launching technology-based startups now find himself at the helm of an academic institution, rather than starting another new business? The answer is found in Preheim's lifelong interest in education, including long-term board memberships at two schools (he recently retired as chairman emeritus of the, Indiana., and has continuing involvement with the.) Preheim believes his particular experience within the field of business is uniquely suited to the type of school that Stuart can become.M. Ellen Mitchell, chair of the search committee that selected Preheim, commented, \"Stuart Graduate School of Business is poised for growth. The growing interest in entrepreneurship is something that fits with Tim's strengths and experience. The search committee agreed that the Stuart School could benefit greatly from Tim's leadership skills and his entrepreneurial background to help move the institution to the next level of excellence.\"\"I'm going to borrow very heavily from my business experience,\" Preheim says. \"A sense of community and teamwork are very exceptionally key in what we need to do to create a unique Stuart experience. We need to embrace what already differentiates us in the market and take advantage of the whole technological capability that exists within IIT.\"As a business school within a university having \"technology\" as its last name, Stuart is in a fortuitous position to forge new partnerships, Preheim adds. For instance, a conceivable program could integrate the creative design, architectural skills and engineering skills of,andwith a real estate-development concentration or focus within the Stuart MBA. This would create a joint program located in a city that is known internationally as a hub for real estate. Preheim is also quick to mention that although there are already stellar programs like Stuart's environmental management program that enjoy both national attention and ranking, Stuart shouldn't be in a rush to compete in a head-to-head fashion with business schools like(his business school alma mater).\"We're different from them, and we should be. Schools like University of Chicago have more than four times our enrollment. But smaller size gives us certain advantages. When you're small, you're nimble. We can do things quickly that others can't. Another competitive advantage is we have more international students than any of the major institutions in Chicago in both percentage and real numbers. We need to take advantage of this fact in our overall program development at Stuart.\"Stuart's new ethos will thus be an orientation toward entrepreneurial and \"real-life\" business experience, with a passion for the highest quality education. \"I've had the opportunity to gain personal experience at two top-five institutions,\" Preheim says, having studied atas an undergraduate before going on to U of C. \"And I don't subscribe to the idea that business and education need to have totally different personalities. In business, I took the things that I did and didn't like about corporate America, and I built a company based on that. I talk regularly with alums from those businesses, and we all love what we built, because we understood the mission, and we had a tremendous amount of fun and mutual success.

The stage fills with chatter about decorating a Christmas table, but one person interrupts claiming the stove is on fire. There is neither a table nor emergency, no script or direction. It's improvisational theater, and the people aren't actors but group therapy patients seeking psychological treatment.Improvisational theater exercises, more popularly known as \"improv,\" have long been used in therapy. As early as the 1960s, Viola Spolin pioneered exercises designed to tap into one's self-expression and creativity. Over the years, psychologists have found several mental health benefits for patients from integrating improv into their practice, such as reducing anxiety and treating depression.Kristin Krueger (Ph.D. PSYC '04) first encountered improv when a friend convinced her to enroll in a class in 2006. She says that improv helped her to overcome many of her inhibitions and feelings of self-consciousness, helping her extend past her comfort zone and improving her personal interactions. Taking interest in improv as a cognitive activity, Krueger decided to create a small clinical study based on mental health outcomes when she worked for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.\"I wanted to see if all the great things people say about improv could be measured, that it increases how you feel about yourself, that it reduces your depressive symptoms and anxiety and increases your self-esteem,\" she says. The results of the study conducted by Krueger along with two Illinois Tech research collaborators were published in the paperin the(July 2017).Krueger interviewed each person in her weekly practice treatment group individually, starting with an introductory survey on demographic information. She took five qualities designed to highlight mental health outcomes\u2014anxiety, depression, self-esteem, satisfaction with social roles, and perfectionism\u2014and found significant improvements in self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, alongside a trend for reduced perfectionism among participants after improv therapy.\"I wanted to see if all the great things people say about improv could be measured, that it increases how you feel about yourself, that it reduces your depressive symptoms and anxiety and increases your self-esteem\"\u2014Kristin KruegerHow is this addressed in practice? Besides doing improv skits, Krueger may select a game that targets a specific concern that commonly affects patients, such as fear of failure. The participants will then engage in a challenging exercise, and they will be required to celebrate every move they make, especially when they fail at it or make some kind of error. After the exercise, the group is given a chance to reflect on the experience.\"Improv in and of itself probably addresses several areas; that is the nature of improv,\" Krueger says. \"If they can recall a time when they were very courageous, they might also be courageous the next time they have to do something difficult at work or in a social situation.\"Krueger is currently working on a second study that seeks to categorize improv exercises based on cognitive activities. Her method involves inviting clinical neuropsychologists or trainees and having them participate in games, such as \"Wind and Rewind,\" which sharpens memory. Seated in a circle, participants go in order and say words that they associate with the beginning word. After the last person goes, everyone starts to chant the words in reverse order.\"I was impressed that Dr. Krueger was able to put this study together so that we can support claims about improv exercising specific parts of the brain and those skills,\" says Sherrie All, a clinical psychologist who owns the Chicago Center for Cognitive Wellness. \"We're getting a lot of new evidence to show that the adult brain can continue to grow or change throughout the entire lifespan.\"Outside of her private practice in Elmhurst, Illinois, Krueger partakes in the Chicago-based improv troupe, composed solely of psychotherapists, who are all trained in improv. A hit at many mental health conferences and meetings as well as at The Den Theatre and Stage 773 in Chicago and Oak Park's Open Door Theater, the troupe bases about half of its skits on its work."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2002/pioneers-wanted", "content": "The burgeoning field of biomedical engineering, though still youthful, has shown unusual promise in areas as diverse as vascular replacement and implantable microchips that relay patient medical information.

Prosthetic devices routinely replace bones, joints, extremities, ailing internal organs and even skin while skillfully engineered drugs treat illnesses from the common cold to all manner of life-threatening ailments.Having already transformed our world, biomedical engineering is poised for significant breakthroughs in the coming decades. As, director of, explains, \"Many people think it will be the engineering discipline of the future due to the rapid growth in our understanding of the biological building blocks, permitting ever more innovative advances by engineers.\"IIT has emerged a leader in this new frontier of engineering and medical technology, conducting pioneering work in pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures, cell and tissue research, medical imaging techniques and neural prostheses. With an ambitious new biomedical initiative, begun in March of last year, IIT plans to significantly broaden the extent of its biomedical endeavors by integrating biomedical engineering and several related disciplines in a new campus complex. Teaching, research and a wide array of entrepreneurial activities will share resources, lab facilities and advanced instrumentation.At the heart of this elaborate undertaking is the new Biomedical Research and Development Complex. Incorporating some 300,000 square feet of existing building space, the extensively renovated and redesigned complex will integrate three existing structures into one all-inclusive setting. Central to the complex is the Engineering Research Building, or ERB. Here IIT will house its much-expanded biomedical engineering program, including teaching and research labs, incubator facilities for launching new biomedical companies and the newly formed Particle Technology and Crystallization Center, or PTCC.In 1999, IIT launched its doctoral program in, and this year the first undergraduate students will embark on studies in this intensely interdisciplinary field. Partial funding for the new program has been obtained from the, a private non-profit organization devoted to supporting biomedical engineering research and education. IIT's program focuses on three areas:-a fast growing area of research, which involves a basic understanding of the chemical and physical factors that influence cell function with the goal of replacing damaged or diseased tissues and organs;-groundbreaking research into neural prosthetics to restore visual, hearing and other neurologically related deficits; and-research exploring new methodologies to visualize internal body parts and bodily functions in a non-invasive manner.Through interdisciplinary course work in engineering and related fields- the biological, chemical and physical sciences; chemical and environmental engineering; computer science; electrical and computer engineering; and mechanical, materials and aerospace engineering, IIT will prepare undergraduate students for the challenges they will face in conducting such research. Students will also receive supportive training from theand the Center for Ethics in the Professions, as well as from business and law specialists. Such interdisciplinary instruction, a hallmark of IIT's educational approach, will deepen students' appreciation of ethical, psychological, business, and regulatory issues related to biomedical engineering.IIT has already invested some $3 million in the renovation of the ERB, making available 30,000 square feet of space. The bulk of this space consists of hooded and wet laboratory facilities for biomedical and chemical engineering. Grants of $6 million from the State of Illinois will support further design and renovation of the biomedical complex. IIT undergraduate research facilities, comprising laboratories devoted to instrumentation, physiology and transport, as well as a senior projects lab, are included in the proposed ERB laboratory build-out. A graduate lab for instrumentation and neural engineering instruction will likewise be integrated into the new complex. The Chemical Research Building or CRB, contiguous to the ERB, aims to augment the complex with additional space for start-up, graduate and existing companies in the biomedical and chemical engineering fields.IIT's Particle Technology and Crystallization Center, also housed in the new complex, is a collaborative effort involving,,,,and other major pharmaceutical companies. PTCC research involves polymorphism the ability of given pharmaceutical compounds to form distinct crystal configurations from the same atoms.Through integration of the existing Life Sciences division of the IIT Research Institute, or IITRI, the university introduces another core component of its biomedical research complex. Adjacent to the ERB and CRB, the incorporation of IITRI Life Sciences will allow faculty and students to share instrumentation and resources., director of the IITRI Life Sciences division and professor of biology at IIT;, dean of Armour College of Engineering and Science at IIT; and Vincent Turitto, chairman of IIT's newly created biomedical engineering department and director of the Pritzker Institute of Medical Engineering, will, together, oversee the integration process.According to Dean Myerson, \"The integration of teaching and research laboratories with instrumentation and R&D facilities, the combined presence of undergraduate and graduate students and faculty, plus incubator facilities to launch entrepreneurial ventures and graduate space for next-stage development and commercialization of new discoveries, will, when pulled together, create a unique synergy.\" With the active collaboration of academies and industry beyond the IIT campus, the new initiative will provide fertile ground for learning, discovery and commercialization of cutting-edge biomedical engineering advances.A significant advantage to IIT's new Biomedical Complex is its proximity to. In partnership with IIT, Argonne will provide access to the- a critical research tool used to investigate protein structure, develop new diagnostic procedures, characterize materials and aid in drug discovery. IIT foresees additional collaborative opportunities in teaching, biomedical research and commercial applications with theand.With the university's elaborate new biomedical engineering facility well underway, IIT takes a step closer to the goals of its biomedical initiative. Illinois Institute of Technology assembles students, faculty and industry participants in one of the 21st century's most promising domains- an intensely interdisciplinary setting designed to foster creativity and promote new ideas. Participation of additional IIT faculty in diverse disciplines including law, business and psychology, combined with the diverse collaborative involvement of universities, area medical schools and industry, ensure that IIT's initiative in biomedical engineering will strengthen the institution's commanding role at the forefront of this stimulating field.Richard Harth is a science journalist and freelance writer.

He and his team drew hungry colleagues after determining the performance of The Best Toaster Oven and visited a university facility where underwater testing was conducted on The Best Talking Scale. (Don't ask him about the crickets that went missing as his team conducted tests on The Best Bug Vacuum.)Sometimes it's back to the drawing board. As head of product development, Faraj, along with his team, had an idea for a car dashboard heater and worked with a vendor to produce one to feature in a winter catalog. The item was popular, but too many customers complained that the heater fell off the dash if the driver applied the brakes too quickly. The item was restyled, but it didn't project enough heat, so it was returned to the vendor for further refinements.\"If only one customer complains about something, I take a personal responsibility to ensure that customer's happiness from a quality point of view,\" says Faraj. While he acknowledges that the web has given purchasers a world of choices, he says that Hammacher Schlemmer, supported by his team's efforts, qualifies for \"The Best.\"\"The Hammacher Schlemmer brand is still there,\" he says. \"We understand our customer.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2018/star-power", "content": "V, having completed its spectacular photo safari of our solar system, has one more destination in store. But don't bother waiting around. Speeding across the lonely interstellar void at 38,000 miles per hour,'s fastest probe isn't due to approach AC+79 3888\u2014a nearby star\u2014for about 40,000 years.Those seeking to travel far beyond Earth face many complex challenges, though according to John Brophy (ME '78), the most formidable hurdle is easily defined: \"Space is big,\" he says.Even as stargazers today enjoy an up-close and personal view of the cosmos, thanks to remarkable ground- and space-based instruments, the prospect of ever visiting a star beyond our solar system still seems impossibly remote.\u00a0 The nearest candidate, Proxima Centauri, winks at us from nearly 25-trillion miles away. Even modest journeys within our solar system present daunting challenges, due to the distances involved.Brophy is approaching the problem of the enormity of space by designing advanced propulsion systems to carry probes similar to Voyager, and perhaps one day human expeditions, over greater distances with unprecedented speed.He began working on advanced technologies known as ion propulsion systems at Colorado State University, where he completed his Ph.D. in 1984. Since 1985 he has been an engineer in electric propulsion technology development for the(JPL), in Pasadena, California, where he is now an engineering fellow.As Brophy explains, one of the primary limitations of earlier spacecraft, such as the Saturn V/Apollo 11 vehicle, which carried astronauts to the moon, is the enormous weight of the chemical fuel that has to be carried aboard such rockets. This approach is simply too heavy, ungainly, and inefficient for fast, long-range voyages.To propel the spacecraft forward, rockets spew gas from their engine nozzles at high velocity. A formula based on the conservation of momentum says that the desired spacecraft velocity and the rate at which exhaust comes out of the rocket engine govern the amount of propellant needed. Known as the, this principle places severe upper limits on the practicality of conventional spaceflight over large distances.\"The solution is to decouple the propellant from the source of energy used to accelerate it,\" Brophy says. These advanced systems, known as ion propulsion, gather energy from the sun using onboard solar panels to convert this radiant energy into electricity to run the ion thrusters.Rather than burning a chemical propellant as in conventional rockets, ion propulsion creates thrust by producing and accelerating a beam of charged particles, or ions, with electricity. The technique creates very high exhaust velocities on the order of 40,000 meters per second. \"That is about 10 times faster than the best chemical rocket engine,\" Brophy says.helped implement the idea of ion propulsion on NASA'smission, which performed a successful flyby of the asteroid Braille and then the comet Borrelly. He later designed the ion propulsion system for the ambitiousproject to rendezvous with protoplanet Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres. In 2015 Brophy was part of the Dawn team that received the Robert J. Collier Trophy from thefor his ion propulsion system on NASA's Dawn mission.Still, as Brophy notes, existing ion propulsion systems have their limitations for long-distance travel. Gaining additional power for the ion thrusters requires larger onboard solar arrays that add to the craft's weight and reduce its speed.The radical solution proposed is to replace the sun as the external power source with a massive, space-based array of high-intensity lasers, spread over 1 to 3 kilometers, beaming light energy to the spacecraft across astronomical distances and providing around 100 megawatts of power to the spacecraft. The spacecraft would carry photovoltaic cells specifically tuned to the frequency of impending laser light and convert this power to electricity.\"If you had something like that, what could you do with it?\"asks. \"It turns out that you can do some pretty amazing things.\"Such technology would permit travel to an exotic locale known as the solar gravity lens focus location, a region of space that begins about 550 astronomical units (AU) from Earth. (1 AU is the distance from Earth to the sun.) Here, the sun's gravitational field can be used like a gigantic magnifying glass, permitting spectacular imaging of distant planets.\"To put this in perspective, the Voyager spacecraft, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, has been flying for 40 years and is at about 140 AU. We want to go to 550 AU and we want to do it in 10 to 15 years,\" Brophy says. \"That's the challenge.\"Controlled propulsion at such a pace\u2014around 400,000 to 500,000 mph\u2014would potentially open up a range of other enticing possibilities, including human missions to Mars and Jupiter, robotic orbiter missions to Pluto, asteroid mining operations, and the ability to deflect nearby asteroids from a catastrophic collision with Earth."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2002", "content": "The burgeoning field of biomedical engineering, though still youthful, has shown unusual promise in areas as diverse as vascular replacement and implantable microchips that relay patient medical information.

But for the, it was merely a warm-up. In 2012 the global construction, civil engineering, and real estate development conglomerate announced that it had begun research so that it could assemble a 96,000-kilometer (59,652-mile)cable that will extend from Earth into the cosmos to support a space elevator. Akihisa \"Aki\" Miwa (M.S. OR '83), general manager of Obayashi's Technical Division, says that the company, where he has been employed since 1974, has always had one eye just beyond the horizon.\"Regarding technology development, we are spending 70 to 80 percent of our budget on current issues; 20 percent of our budget is for future things\u2014sometimes dreams, too,\" Miwa says, with a hint of a smile, noting that no matter the project, his company's focus is on benefiting society.With a target year of 2050 for the completion of the space elevator, whose price tag is as yet undetermined, Miwa, who oversees the project's engineering team, says that the lift would carry humans and equipment to various celestial waystations for tourism, commerce, and exploration. At an estimated space cargo delivery cost of about $100 per pound, the elevator could replace conventional rocket launches at a significant savings both in cost and to the environment.On Mies Campus last December to accept Illinois Tech's 2016 International Award of Merit, Miwa also made a presentation about the, the TOKYO SKYTREE, and other innovative Obayashi projects including the award-winning, a.k.a., the Hoover Dam Bridge, the longest arch concrete bridge in the Western hemisphere, completed in 2010.

It was 1990, and Zhang had just wrapped up his master's degree in mechanical engineering at Illinois Tech. He had completed a three-month internship at Honeywell subsidiaryin Des Plaines, Illinois, and loved it, but there was a serious problem: In order to pursue a career at UOP, he would need to drop mechanical engineering, the discipline to which he had just devoted six years of study, and instead become a chemical engineer. No problem, Zhang figured. He left the doctoral program he'd enrolled in and earned his Ph.D. in chemical engineering, while also working part-time at UOP. He has never looked back.Much of that time Zhang (M.S. MAE '89, Ph.D. CHE '92) spent working in Beijing as a chief representative with UOP. A Shanghai native, he helped to spur tenfold growth in six years in China for UOP in the 2000s, a performance that ultimately earned him his next role as vice president and general manager of Performance Materials and Technologies, Asia. Since 2015 he's been president of Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS), the corporation's technology research-and-development and engineering division. In this role, Zhang is able to combine his engineering acumen and R&D experience with his sales and management expertise to push HTS toward next-generation innovation. HTS has more than 9,500 employees\u2014most of them engineers\u2014based in India, China, Mexico, and the Czech Republic.\"I'm in a perfect position to lead an engineering organization because I do have that background, but I can take a lot of the skills I've learned from the business community and apply them back to engineering management and back to innovation,\" says Zhang.At HTS, Zhang has done just that. One example is the Air Touch, an air purifier initially marketed in China, where air pollution is a major concern. The Air Touch is a consumer product that makes use of some of Honeywell's R&D expertise in industries that are very much nonconsumer\u2014it integrated Honeywell's technology strengths in materials science, aerodynamics, sensing and controls, human factors, and software to quickly design and manufacture the first local-born commercial air purifier. The result is a lightweight, polycarbonate purifier with multiple subfilters that excels at quickly converting toxic environments into healthy, breathable spaces.\"We saw an excellent opportunity to solve an important human problem, as well as a business opportunity,\" says Zhang. After a successful launch in China, Air Touch is now sold in additional regions such as India, Russia, and the Middle East.Zhang's combination of marketing savvy and engineering know-how has endeared him to Honeywell's leadership.\"Scott's great technical depth and breadth coupled with superb business acumen and people focus\" is spurring his success at HTS, according to Krishna Mikkilineni, Honeywell's senior vice president for engineering, operations, and IT. \"He is doing a spectacular job and is making Honeywell look good in the market. Scott is a rare global citizen with a great heart.\"Zhang enjoys traveling\u2014and it's a good thing, considering he spends more than half the year on the road, away from his wife and 6-year-old daughter in Shanghai. That's the nature of overseeing HTS's four, far-flung tech centers overseas as well as making regular visits to Honeywell's New Jersey headquarters.He's also very involved with Honeywell's university outreach programs, particularly in China, India, Mexico, and the Czech Republic, the countries where HTS tech centers are located. The cornerstone of these efforts is the Honeywell Initiative for Science and Engineering.spend time interacting with university students\u2014lecturing, providing counsel to them on their projects, giving career talks, and answering questions as a way to engage students.\"Part of our responsibility as a company is to support the research programs and professors that we ultimately benefit from,\" says Zhang. \"Personally, I also want to share my own experience with the young talent and ensure I turn them on to engineering and encourage them to join our field.\"Those campus visits remind Zhang of his own educational experience, one that began with an undergraduate degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1982 and culminated in a recruiting visit from Illinois Tech mechanical engineering professor and solar-energy pioneer Zalman Lavan (M.S. ME '62, Ph.D. '65). Lavan encouraged Zhang to come to Chicago, a decision that appealed to Zhang as a budding academic as well as a basketball fan. While at the university, Zhang frequented the United Center, where he would buy cheap seats to catch a glimpse of Michael Jordan in action. Decades later, he remains a Bulls fan and considers Chicago to be his second home. He feels similarly about his alma mater, Illinois Tech.\"IIT is always near to my heart.

When it came, they held their partners stiffly, looking down at their feet and mentally reviewing the steps they had just learned during the group lesson. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.At the end of the lesson, a few of the more outgoing men hung around to talk to their female instructors\u2014actually fellow students\u2014about the dance steps, their plans for the weekend ... and whether they knew the answers to that week's chemistry homework.This spring, six IIT alumnae from the 1940s and 1950s met for lunch at thein downtown Chicago. Arriving separately, they recognized one another immediately and greeted each other warmly. To an outside observer watching the lively conversation and easy laughter, they appeared to be good friends catching up. And yet the paths of most of these women did not cross in the years after they left IIT. On this May afternoon, however, Karin Turnquist, Marie Ekvall, Rosette Backas, Alice Koplan, Millie Delahunty, and Jeanette Metzdorf celebrated the alumnae bond that still joins them after more than 50 years. That distinction is an especially powerful one for emeritus alumnae (those who graduated before 1955), as they were outnumbered by male students by as much as 33 to 1. \"You were very aware of the other women on campus,\" said Delahunty. Backas added, \"It was very hard to be inconspicuous.\"\u00a0Turnquist had a particularly memorable experience of the 'fishbowl' environment on campus. \"I changed my outfit at a fraternity house dance and accidentally left it there and it was later written up in the school newspaper,\" she laughed.Although their presence on campus was visibly noticeable, making their voices heard took a little more work, a challenge the women did not shy away from. Walking into a physical education class, which was at that time a required course, Delahunty and her female classmates were told that there was no programming or facilities in place for women.\"The instructor threw up his hands and said to us, 'Why don't you just do whatever you want?'\" said Delahunty. The women would indeed do just that: \"Being the agitators we were, we worked on the administration until we got a part-time female physical education instructor and had part of the locker room partitioned off for us,\" said Delahunty. \"We didn't take no for an answer,\" added Kopan.While these women advocated for physical amenities on campus, they also worked hard to change the perceptions of those around them. \"Going into such a male-dominated college, there was an attitude that we were going to get our 'MRS' degrees,\" said Delahunty.If that was the initial opinion held by fellow students and faculty, however, the women quickly reversed it by excelling academically. \"I remember my firstclass,\" said Delahunty. \"The instructor said, 'Look to your right and to your left. Two of you won't be here next year. And it was true. And the ones who weren't there were men.\"This strong intellect and determination to succeed academically presented a minor social conflict for women at that time. \"If I was dating someone and I earned a higher grade than he did, I noticed a change in his behavior,\" said Kopan. \"After awhile I just decided to keep my mouth shut.\" From the nods her comments elicited around the lunch table, it's clear that it wasn't uncommon for IIT women to find themselves in that situation.While the men on campus may not have been receptive to women competing with them academically, they did allow the women to help them sharpen their social skills.\"We taught the engineers how to dance,\" Delahunty recollected. \"We lined them up in the auditorium and taught them the steps to the fox trot and the waltz, then took each of them around the hall once.\" Laughing, she added, \"We considered it a public service.\"With the exception of Turnquist, who graduated with a degree in, and Metzdorf, who received a degree in arts and sciences, the other four alumnae studied home economics\u2014a popular academic path for women at that time. While the phrase 'home economics' may conjure images of Martha Stewart home improvement projects, IIT's program was not for anyone lacking left-brain skills.\"Some of the home economics programs at other schools didn't even have laboratory courses. At IIT we had four years of labs, including chemistry,, and bacteriology,\" said Ekvall. That background led Ekvall to a successful 25-year career with the U.S.. \"At the FDA, you work with all kinds of nutrition, medicines, and radiation. I had to have that strong science background.\" Along with the rigorous curriculum, the women identify IIT's focus on critical thinking as an important part of their education. \"Regardless of the discipline, IIT taught us critical thinking skills that have benefited us throughout our careers and our lives,\" said Kopan.The business courses included in IIT's home economics curriculum also provided the women with tools for success in the workplace, including Delahunty, whose job immediately after college entailed covering a tri-state sales area. \"Having worked and studied and negotiated with men for four years at IIT, I was in good shape to work with them when I graduated,\" Delahunty said.Exposure to a multitude of disciplines, including business, science, and economics, led these women to develop some particularly innovative ideas. \"At one time, a group of us sat out on the lawn developing a plan for a shopping mall,\" said Kopan. Although the idea didn't materialize as the women went their separate ways, they realized what a revolutionary concept they had created when the first enclosed shopping mall in the United States opened its doors a few years later.Reminiscing about their own experiences as students, the women were excited to learn that the male-to-female student ratio at IIT is no longer 33 to 1, but 3 to 1, and to hear that women are better represented across all disciplines. Metzdorf, a member of IIT's first graduating class of 1941 after the merger ofand, has noticed the diversity in her sorority contemporaries. \"Many of my youngcohorts now are engineers and architects,\" she said.The energy around the dining table was palpable as the afternoon progressed and the six alumnae discussed the importance of capturing the history of women at IIT. \"I think there are a lot of wonderful success stories that need to be told,\"\u00a0said Ekvall.As they chatted about ways to reengage IIT alumnae, it wasn't hard for an outside observer to imagine them as they must have been years ago firmly arguing with administrators over the need for a physical education instructor, confidently directing engineers in the art of the fox trot, and channeling their determination, energy, and skills into successful career and community endeavors.\"I hope today's gathering serves as a springboard to greater things,\" said Kopan as the women said their good-byes. If their tales of perseverance and ingenuity are any indication, there's no doubt that that hope will soon become a reality.Although the concept of 'interprofessionalism' didn't formally make its way into IIT's curriculum until the 1990s, all alumnae of the 1940s and 1950s, regardless of their majors, benefited from an education that combined their core curriculum with business and science fundamentals. As a result, these six alumnae with degrees in home economics, biology, and arts and sciences have parlayed their rich education into an impressive array of career experiences.worked as a research and development chemist, then served as head of a quality control lab.

Overnight, products and services appear that just days before we were unaware of\u2014for example, the ability to now use a cell phone to send a photograph of the house we've just built to a friend half way around the world.Technology isn't the only area where change is rampant. Lifestyles are constantly being reconfigured, with demographic patterns in such flux that it may be misleading to call them patterns. All these rapid changes are making it more and more difficult to predict how people as consumers want and need to be served.Finding out is the goal at IIT's Institute of Design (ID), where researchers develop methods that will help organizations gain a more detailed and relevant understanding of users' increasingly complex lives and drive the development of innovative and humane products and business concepts. Put simply, ID faculty and students study exactly how people live and work and then strive to develop ideal products, systems, and concepts for them\u2014a task that is every bit as challenging as it sounds.So how do designers reach that critical intersection of need and product design\u2014referred to as the \"sweet spot\"?The Bauhaus (a coined word meaning something like \"construction house\") had been founded by Walter Gropius as a new type of school of architecture, art, and design. Its stated goal was to promote \"a new unity of art, science, and technology in the service of humanity.\" Its educational approach was holistic\u2014educating the entire person in the belief that such an education would give students a better grasp of society and how products they designed could improve it. Experimentation was encouraged, with an emphasis on process.Moholy-Nagy brought the Bauhaus philosophy to Chicago, and that legacy of human-centered design still flourishes at ID, where students are given instruction and practice in the study of people\u2014these days referred to as users or end-users. This research is called activity-focused and encompasses a broad range of actions, circumstances, and environments\u2014for example, note-taking in an airplane seat, telecommunicating, accessing the water supply in an urban slum, threading through traffic on a crowded Internet, or taking blood in a lab. As a result of this trained observation, designers can identify important components of user needs and requirements that might otherwise have been missed.ID uses this information within a broad framework that supports understanding users from multiple perspectives, addressing not only the users' physical capabilities and cognitive functions, but also their cultural backgrounds and the social situations in which they operate when using a product or service. ID has gotten so good at this that the institute has become an international leader in teaching human-centered design.According to Vincent LaConte, communications manager at ID, current trends in design see a concentration of work in the areas of environment and health, with interactive learning and home environment now starting to get more attention. At IIT, where the goal has always been to use design research to make life better, several initiatives are working toward that goal.One current ID initiative is the Urban Opportunity Project. Begun in 2003, the project was formed to explore urban global slums and then to develop human-centered strategies for products, services, and businesses that could generate sustainable economic development and improved living in these areas.A slum household is defined by UN-Habitat as a group of individuals living under the same roof who lack one or more of the following: security of tenure, structural quality and durability of dwellings, access to safe water, access to sanitation facilities, or sufficient living area. The project's initial focus has been in India, with a long-term focus of creating a replicable model for slums around the world.Sam Pitroda (EE '66)\u2014telecommunications pioneer and recipient of the IIT Alumni Award Medal, India's National Citizen Award, and an International Distinguished Leadership Award\u2014has been a galvanizing force as the project advisor. His extensive expertise in international business and politics, along with his global perspective, have been invaluable in helping team members apply the best of design research to improve the worst of living conditions.The goal has been not to apply a bandage, but to discover systemic solutions to the complex problems in daily life\u2014such as water quality, healthcare, and sanitation\u2014as well as related problems of unemployment, communication, and education.To get a broad framework for understanding slums, research was conducted in slum areas in Mumbai, India. By observing the daily life, the Chicago-based team of researcher-designers\u2014led by Patrick Whitney, the lead faculty member and director of ID\u2014discovered patterns of social interaction, economic activity, and living conditions that inspired ideas for new solutions.Interestingly, they discovered a variety of profitable businesses already in and around the slum\u2014seasonal, transient, and mobile\u2014and both large- and small-scale industries. After analyzing these businesses and related activities, the team designed \"solution concepts.\" Among them is JobShop & Skill Registry\u2014a job search service for skilled laborers that would not only help slum dwellers find work, but also help them establish a credit record and professional reputation, giving them more value on the labor market. Another solution is Mobile H20, a business that would supply fresh water to slum homes, getting better quality water to more people more reliably, thereby helping to reduce disease and create new jobs. In each case, the team's goal is to create a large-scale solution prototype that can be used in other urban areas with similar problems and challenges.As we become a more global society, one of the challenges is learning how to participate on a much larger and far less familiar playing field. The initiative Global Companies in Local Markets was designed to meet this challenge by applying human-centered design research methods while observing the activities of daily life that surround a product or service.This is called the activity-focused method, and can be applied rapidly to the process of developing new products and services. For example, a close-up, hands-on observation of how a family shops for food, cooks, and serves meals results in more specific insights than traditional anthropological studies would generate about whether a particular western-generated kitchen appliance will sell in a different culture.In addition to activity-focused research indicating whether a product or service may be culturally and socially appropriate for the target market, the results will also indicate where a company may need to make critical accommodations to the behaviors, beliefs, and aspirations of local cultures.In the world of health care, a recent Interprofessional (IPRO) project at ID resulted in an improved method for drawing blood. Designed by student Adriano Galvao, BloodValve simplifies the process of selecting, attaching, and handling vials during the blood-drawing process. With the cost of specimen collection errors reaching $200,000 per year or more in large hospitals, BloodValve provides a new way to draw blood more safely\u2014reducing errors, increasing efficiency, and improving the quality of patient care. The project received an IDSA/BusinessWeek design competition award\u2014the second Industrial Design Excellence Award the school has won in three years. Because the product has universal application, the benefits of this research are bound to have global impact.This is an excellent example of how the design program inherited from visionary thinkers like Moholy-Nagy, and Gropius before him, is intended to work. Alumna Melody Roberts (DSGN 2001) is putting activity-focused research skills learned at IIT to good use seeking and finding sweet spots as a designer-researcher at IDEO, most recently in the hot new areas of knowledge transfer and privacy issues. Before Roberts enrolled at ID, she had already attended other design schools, but was dissatisfied with their traditional approach to product development. She decided to come to IIT only after she learned about ID's design philosophy from Professor John Heskett at a presentation to prospective students in May of 1994. She remembers Heskett's talk well. \"He nearly jumped out of his black Reeboks describing the ID program,\" she recalls. \"It was the process of discovery Heskett was describing, and his enthusiasm for the rewards of the activity-focused approach, that won me over.\"In discussing future enhancements to the award-winning design school, LaConte points out that the design business is inevitably forward looking\u2014always trying to keep up with changes in the way people work and live that influence the never-ending search for sweet spots. \"But it's also important,\" he says, \"to pause occasionally and honor our legacy. As much as the world of design is about products and systems, it's also about vision.\" From Moholy-Nagy's time to the present, that has been the sustaining core of ID\u2014the art of envisioning the world the way it should, and perhaps could, be."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2005/design-lens-eye-view", "content": "has a celebrated history as the only photography program in the nation to have had major museum shows and substantial books devoted to its methods and alumni.Because photography is a way of understanding the world and communicating that understanding, it is an integral part of the Institute of Design's (ID) Foundation program, a one-year immersion in design for incoming graduate students who don't have a design background.These students use photography as a tool for exploring the formal properties of images\u2014color strategies, figure/ground relationships, visual hierarchy\u2014and as a way of learning to closely observe the subject in its relation to time and social meaning as revealed through the unique properties of the medium.\"Photography class makes you painfully aware of seeing the world in context.

Principles of hierarchy, figure-ground relationships, and color strategies, for example, translate directly from photography and are directly applicable in a variety of media.\"\"Photography is a way to express ideas, trigger emotions, and convey information using still photographs.

Each fall, between 40 and 50 go all out to help incoming undergraduates settle into their home away from home as quickly and effortlessly as possible\u2014and have a lot of fun in the process.A four-day affair, orientation is designed to get students through the logistics of checking in and setting up house while getting familiar with the university. During an ambitious and varied schedule of meetings and activities, incoming students have the opportunity to learn about university resources, interact with professors, and make new friends.Mary Taylor-Blasi, director of Student Activities and, has one major objective for those critical four days: to give new students all the information and support they need to get off to a great start at IIT. \"My job,\" she says, \"revolves around showing them that the university cares about each and every one of them and is committed to their success.\"The crew that works most closely with the students is a team of orientation counselors. Freshmen who are especially pleased with their own introduction to IIT sign up as counselors for their sophomore year, and some return yet again the following year and serve as team leaders. Peer counselors receive a modest stipend and devote four Saturdays in the spring to intensive training and idea sharing in preparation for the fall program. In June, the counselors initiate first contact with their 15 to 20 freshmen via e-mail and often remain friends with them throughout their time at IIT and beyond.IIT senior inLynn Kohlhaas has served at three orientations, two as a team leader. One improvement since she started at IIT is that incoming students are contacted much earlier\u2014in June\u2014which gets everyone connected and makes the planning easier.This happened in a big way in 2003, Kohlhaas says, with the addition of an online forum where information is posted, questions get answered, and everyone has a chance to get \"pre-acquainted.\" The incoming students can add topics and form their own discussion groups well before arriving at IIT. New in 2004 were handwritten postcards and printed business cards used by the orientation counselors.Other key support groups are the, whose president, vice president, and treasurer were all fall 2004 counselors, and the International Student Organization, which sponsors a \"Meet and Greet\" service, picking up new international students at the airport and escorting them to campus.Taylor-Blasi says the knowledge that the counselors and other participants share and the care they exhibit for incoming students create a sense of community that greatly enhances student life at IIT.To see the full range of activities for fall 2004 orientation, visit."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/category/features?page=8", "content": "A faint whiff of an odor first experienced in childhood may conjure a host of vivid recollections.

When structural engineers reach immortality, their colleagues present them with a volume of research papers celebrating the breadth of their research.Such was the gift presented to, Perlstein Distinguished Professor of Engineering, upon his 70th birthday. A group of former students, research collaborators and colleagues came together to write papers on topics related to his research. The publication, Engineering Science of Structures, celebrates the accomplishments he made in structural engineering.Foregoing a promising career as a pianist to follow his dream of becoming an engineer, Guralnick enrolled at, where he earned a bachelor's degree in. He enrolled in Drexel's five-year co-op program, spending two quarters in the classroom and two quarters working each year. He held jobs with thein the engineering test and evaluation department, with a subcontractor doing stone, tile, slate and terrazzo work, and with Atlantic Refining Corporation (now).\"Co-op is a wonderful way to go to engineering school,\" Guralnick says, \"because you get to see the results of what you're learning actually being practiced in the field. Most undergraduates don't get to see that.\"In 1952, Guralnick was appointed as an instructor and manager of the structural engineering research laboratory at, which enabled him to pursue graduate studies there. As a graduate student, he managed several large research projects on reinforced concrete structures and light-gage steel structures and also taught courses in concrete structures, steel structures, and the analysis of statically determinate and indeterminate structures. After earning his Ph.D. in 1958, he became an assistant professor ofat Cornell, but soon decided it was time to move to Chicago, which was an important center for the practice of structural engineering.When Guralnick left Cornell to become an assistant professor at IIT, blueprints were still drawn by hand andfinal two buildings had recently been finished: S.R. Crown Hall (1956) and Siegel Hall (1957). Guralnick became actively involved with campus life at IIT early in his career. He served as chairman of the faculty council in 1961 and as the first chairman of the newly created faculty senate in 1962. In 1965, he served as one of the organizers of the World Congress on Engineering Education, held in the then brand-new Hermann Hall.He brought in a traveling Shakespeare company to perform on campus numerous times and set up a weekly lecture schedule in the 1960s and 1970s.In 1975, IIT Presidentappointed Guralnick, who was then dean of the Graduate School, as the University's first provost. He also served as executive vice president and was a member of the IIT Board of Trustees. Throughout these years, his strong work ethic and sound policies had a significant influence in shaping the university.Of his years as provost, Guralnick says, \"One of the things that helped with that responsibility was the fact that I like to solve problems. As provost, I was involved with a number of interesting problems that I was able to solve simply because I have the kind of mind that enables me to work through challenges without a lot of emotion.\" During his first five years in that position, undergraduate enrollment increased by 40 percent and his effective recruitment of a number of outstanding new faculty members caused the annual research volume to more than double.Along with the challenges that came with being provost, Guralnick enjoyed many intangible rewards, one stemming from a late 1970s initiative to honor important alumni. Among them was meeting jazz legend, who attended Lewis Institute in the 1930s. \"We went out to a venue where he was playing and introduced ourselves,\" Guralnick says. \"We told him we wanted to give him an award, and he was very gracious. He had a lot of positive things to say about his experiences at Lewis Institute.\"As both provost and as a professor, Guralnick's primary commitment has always been to the students, helping them achieve the success for which IIT's graduates are known. In 1989, he was awarded IIT's and Armour College's Excellence in Teaching Awards.\"His presence was very encouraging,\" says Yuriy Indman, a graduate student in. \"He has a sense of dedication that emanates and gets inside of you.\"Guralnick's dedication to IIT led him to raise millions of dollars for the university and the Civil and Architectural Engineering (CAE) department's program. His fundraising efforts helped establish theand the. His dedication to building and modernizing the CAE labs has resulted in an impressive array of machinery for studying models of structures and structural materials. These machines range in cost from a few hundred dollars to more than the price of some new homes.When touring the CAE labs he helped modernize, Guralnick leans against a universal testing machine able to exert 800,000 pounds of force and discusses the basics of his research on metal fatigue, a subject that has puzzled researchers for 150 years. In the late 1990s, he developed a system that is able to detect highway pavement deficiencies while traveling at 50 miles per hour.He is clearly a man who loves his work, and it shows whether he's speaking about research or the $12 million he raised as provost, part of which funded the prize-winning Minorities in Engineering program, which enabled IIT to graduate more African-American engineers in the 1980s than all the Big Ten schools combined.\"In addition to being an excellent educator and a superb researcher, he is also a very talented structural engineer,\" says CAE Department Chair. \"His colleagues have benefited immensely from his lectures, directions and, above all, his wisdom. His thoughts on engineering education have provided a clear vision for the future among the engineering education community.\"\"The longevity of his career is remarkable,\" said Megan Folkmann, a 2004 Civil Engineering graduate who took classes with Guralnick. \"He's really dedicated to the Civil and Architectural Engineering program through his teaching and raising money for the laboratories. He really wants to help us have the resources. You get the sense that he wants you to achieve.\"Guralnick, who is retiring this year after an exceptional 46-year career at IIT, says, the university has changed in some ways and remained the same in others. But he thinks that over the years the CAE has garnered a sterling reputation with its graduates. \"We have continued to stay up-to-date with the profession so that we turn out skilled, successful graduates. I plan to continue my research and teaching from time to time. I would miss both if I left completely. I would really miss the students.\"In his wide-ranging career, Guralnick has often given lectures on his research in the United States, Peru, and Switzerland. In addition, he has given general-interest lectures on Roman engineering achievements and the building of the Gothic cathedrals of Europe. In the future he plans to devote more time to exploring these fascinating topics.At the conclusion of a lunch reception and lecture in Guralnick's honor in April, former student and long-time friend William Lavicka, (BS CE '67), presented a $10,000 check toward an endowment to be named for Guralnick that will honor excellence in faculty and student work in Civil and Architectural Engineering. The gift and the many contributions made by John McLaughlin, (BS CE '58, MS CE '70), William Nash, (BS CE '44), and others to aid in laboratory development are fitting tributes to an educator, researcher, and university leader who has left a lasting legacy at IIT as well as in the structural engineering world."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2005/smashing-success", "content": "On May 17, more than 120 IIT trustees, guests, and donors gathered in the emptied out, wrapped S. R. Crown Hall to witness the ceremonial kick-off of the $3.6-million fa\u00e7ade restoration of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's architectural masterpiece. 'Smash Bash' marked the 50th anniversary of Crown Hall and the commencement of its restoration.It was an historic night, with descendants of both the man who designed Crown Hall and the man whose generosity made it possible in attendance. President Lew Collens, addressing the gathering, said, \"Crown Hall is not just a National Historic Landmark, it's a Chicago landmark. It is a gift to the people of Chicago and a vital part of the city's architectural landscape. Fifty years ago it was made possible in large part through the generosity of IIT Trustee Colonel Henry Crown and named in honor of his brother Sol. Crown Hall marked the beginning of a long and wonderful relationship with the Crown family, for which we are profoundly grateful.\"The centerpiece of the event was the breaking of three 10-foot plate glass windows next to the famed south porch. The first person to take up the sledgehammer was Dirk Lohan, Mies' grandson and co-founder of, an architectural design firm. The opportunity to smash the glass was auctioned off on eBay, and Lohan beat out his competitors by placing the high bid.\"It is an honor to be a part of Crown Hall's restoration and its 50th anniversary celebration. As a longtime IIT supporter, this means very much to me. But it means even more on a personal level,\" Lohan said.Wearing hard hats, Lohan and his 10-year-old son, Carsten, swung the golden sledgehammer at the glass, only to have it bounce back. Undaunted by President Collens' shout of 'Strike one!' Lohan and son swung again, this time with enough force to shatter the tempered glass, leaving a hole the size of a watermelon in the center.The next person to wield the hammer was Ralph Wanger, a $1-million contributor to the Mies Society. (The newly renovated south porch was recently named the Ralph and Leah Wanger Porch in honor of the couple's generosity.) The third pane was broken by 14-year-old Jonathan Star, great-grandson of Henry Crown.Once all three windows had been shattered, the guests left the building and gathered around the south porch. President Collens invited IITto do the honors by lowering the official draping on the remaining uncovered section. Crown Hall is scheduled to be reopened at an unwrapping ceremony on August 25, in time for the beginning of the fall semester, and there will be additional improvements to ensure that Crown Hall will continue to serve future architects as 'the best one-room schoolhouse in the world.'Work will comply with current building codes and will adhere as closely as possible to the original appearance of Crown Hall.Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin has called Crown Hall \"one of the finest embodiments of Mies' philosophy of \"less is more\" and one of the seminal structures of the twentieth century. It [is] the High Church of High Modernism. It is the prototype for thousands of convention centers and low-slung suburban office buildings, most of which utterly fail to match its incredibly refined sense of proportions and details.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/category/features?page=7", "content": "\"ASB has been a part of IIT in some form or another for many years and has grown to become one of the most popular service-learning opportunities on this campus.\" For Utsav Gandhi (EMGT '14) and 24 other IIT students, \"a little house somewhere in the innards of mountain country...Just months away from attaining her doctorate, Stephanie Kunkel (M.S.

It hangs in a corner of the factory at Modern Process Equipment, put there not by Dan and Phil Ephraim, Max's sons and operators of the successful company, but by their workers.It is a tribute to the man whose generous spirit touched so many lives, and whose wisdom and humor are still cherished by his family and all who knew him. After Max retired, he spent every Thursday at the factory. He knew more about our workers and their families than we did, says Phil. When my dad was here, the \"factory hum\" on the floor would die down because everyone stopped work to talk to him.The patriarch of three generations of IIT alumni\u2014sons Dan (MBA '76) and Steve (ME '78) and granddaughter Laurel (B.Arch. '94)\u2014Max Ephraim was born on the South Side of Chicago in 1917. His father was Jewish and his mother Irish, and Max experienced the discrimination common to both groups at the time. In spite of his modest beginnings, he attended Armour Tech during the Great Depression and graduated second in his class in just three and a half years with a degree in mechanical engineering all while editing the school newspaper, playing intramural sports, participating in the Rho Delta Rho fraternity, and working two jobs to pay his way through school. After graduation, he took one day off before launching into his career at the Electro-Motive Division (EMD) of General Motors. By the time he retired from EMD in 1983, he had gone from draftsman to chief engineer and had been instrumental in the emergence of the diesel locomotive.His most famous design, the GP7, successfully solidified the transition from steam to diesel locomotives. \"The locomotives built today are all lineal descendants of the GP7,\" says, associate editor of. \"They all have the road switcher and the long hood on the side of the car. The long hood was revolutionary.\" Ephraim also engineered such improvements as better fuel economy with the new \"710\" engine, computerized controls and brakes, and the high-adhesion locomotive, which could more easily go up a steep incline.Because of Max and wife Audrey's modesty, when their nine children were growing up they weren't aware of their father's importance in his field, including his reputation as the father of the modern locomotive. But they were aware of their father's affinity for trains. During family road trips, if he saw a train, he would often get out of his car, climb aboard the train, and start chatting with whomever he found.His son Steve, who is an engineer with, recalls taking a class trip with IIT'schapter to General Motors during his senior year. The EMD representative leading the tour told the group that they had a very rare opportunity to hear from someone of great importance. \"They introduced my father,\" said Steve, \"and the reaction from the professors and students gave me some indication of just how influential he was.\"Max's technical skills were only part of his success; he was also an incredibly effective manager. \"He had an amazing combination of technical, managerial, and interpersonal skills that made him a great leader,\" Phil recalls. \"He would walk through the shop and greet 50 people, and know all their names.\" Once, while escorting GM senior officers on a tour of EMD, Max broke protocol and personally introduced a fork lift operator to GM's chairman, Roger Smith.And he was fun to be around. On the job, he often masterminded elaborate practical jokes. Max carpooled with coworkers, including one who was very proud of his chess skills. Max was just a rookie, but one day he set up a game with the more skilled player at the customary meeting place over lunch. Max's two accomplices, who were expert chess players, began a game directly alongside, mimicking Max's opponent's moves and providing Max with countermoves. The trick was successful until someone came by and noted, \"Hey, isn't that something? Both games have the pieces in exactly the same place!\"Max passed down his three priorities to his family: God, family, and career (in that order). He also passed down a great love for IIT. \"He knew all the words to the fight song,\" recalls granddaughter Laurel. His report card still hangs in his old home office. (He received just one \"B\", which was in English, and he always contended it was only because the instructor didn't care for him.)Today, the nine Ephraim children are scattered across the country, but still consider themselves close-knit and remember their father's impact on their lives with respect and fondness. Max tried not to unduly influence his children in their choice of university, but he helped them navigate their careers. James earned an engineering degree and an MBA and is currently director of business development for a California electronics company. Gary graduated in mechanical engineering and is a senior project manager forin the Chicago area. Alicia enrolled in medical school and is now both a nurse practitioner and owner/operator of a homeopathy clinic in the San Francisco area. Lois is creative director for a West Coast advertising and marketing firm that assists many non-profit organizations. Janet pursued teaching before taking up philanthropic causes, most recently as director of an orphanage in Jakarta, Indonesia. Paul followed directly in his father's footsteps, beginning his career as a draftsman at EMD just five years before Max retired, and continuing his career there as designer.Steve chose IIT for his undergraduate studies in, and although he was a commuter student, he has warm memories of his time spent on campus. One of his favorite experiences was creating a wheelchair that could assist quadriplegics in daily tasks. He also remembers the quirky imaginations of his fellow IIT students, including a homemade \"tennis ball bazooka\" that was used to pitch a ball over 100 meters in a makeshift baseball game. Steve is a project engineer for John Deere in Waterloo, Iowa.Dan went on to study atsoon after its inception. Like his father, he enrolled in an accelerated program and completed his MBA in a year and a half. Just five years after graduating, he and brother Phil purchased, an industrial coffee grinder manufacturer. He credits the rigorous education he received at IIT with developing his business skills, saying, \"In any leadership role, the ability to plan strategically is paramount; IIT provided an excellent base in this regard.\"The company holds a dominant market share throughout North America and Indonesia\u2014and has a strong presence in Russia, South America, and many Mideastern countries. They have also expanded their business into food and chemical equipment.According to Phil's daughter Laurel, Max's unwillingness to push his alma mater onto his children did not extend to his grandchildren; he mentioned the value of an IIT education to her at every available opportunity. Max had her pegged as an engineering student, but she chose to study architecture instead. Laurel also remembers her IIT education as challenging but effective. Many times she saw the sun rise over the CTA Green Line after a night of work in. Now regional marketing coordinator at, her career is still shaped by Max's influence, and she often hearkens back to \"wise words from Grandpa\" when faced with a decision on the job.Max's professional legacy is matched only by his legacy as a philanthropist, on both a grand and intimate scale. Max taught his children that \"you can't just be a good person on the job; you have to be a good person all of the time.\" A devout member of the Assembly of God Church throughout his adulthood, Max helped foundand Chicago's religious television station, Channel 38. Audrey became a chaplain's assistant and regularly visited patients at. The Ephraim home was always open to visitors, particularly to fellow members of the church, and the children recall that you never knew who would show up for Sunday dinner. Guests ranged from a younglaw student named John Ashcroft, to newly-arriving immigrants whom Max would find at the train station. Often homeless and penniless, they were befriended by Max during their transition to their new country. And when Audrey had a stroke, Max became her caregiver for years. She often remarked that she was thankful for her disability, because it proved to her how much her husband loved her.Max was also a tolerant man. He took a genuine interest in each person he met. And \"there was never a simple answer with Max,\" Phil recalls. If you asked him a question, he would give you the entire background on every aspect of it\u2014whether you wanted to know or not. Max even hung a blackboard by the kitchen for problem-solving sessions, a practice his kids found mortifying back then, but now recall fondly. Max and Audrey also shared a great love of travel and journeyed throughout the world, including many mission trips to Africa. While Max was hospitalized towards the end of his life, a new Nigerian doctor once walked into his hospital room. When the doctor gave his name, Max astounded him by correctly guessing both his country and tribe of origin.Collectively, the Ephraim family has been witness to the evolution of IIT from its earliest incarnation as a small technical school to its current manifestation as a multi-campus university of national prominence in design, engineering, and architecture. Throughout this period, the Ephraims have been part of that growth, both as students and benefactors. Following in Max's tracks, the Ephraim family is carrying on his legacy of giving, and doing so in his name, quite literally. A conference room at\u00a0Thehas been named in Max's honor, and a new Max Ephraim Endowed Scholarship in Engineering was created in 2003. The family agrees that Max Ephraim's decision to attendwas the start of what has clearly been a mutually beneficial relationship\u2014through three generations, and counting."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2004/iit-urban-legends", "content": "As with any college, IIT has its share of stories, passed down from class to class, from senior to freshman. But at IIT, these legends don't take the commonplace form of the ghost haunting the women's dormitory. The pragmatic mind of the IIT student has conjured up a different brand of mythology curiously befitting an institute of technology. The rumors and legends of IIT are far too numerous to cover in a single story, but we've picked a few of our favorites to share with you.The tallest building on campus is also the center of some of the tallest tales. If we're to believe the rumors, Big Brother is a constant presence on the IIT campus, and he's a very busy man. Conducting government experiments, bringing in mysterious shipments from the lake via an underground road, and unleashing \"carnivores\" and spy squirrels on innocent students. And where is this work conducted? In the secret basements of IITRI, which supposedly extends as far down as it does up.I took a tour of IIT Tower with Maintenance Supervisor Tim Hinko, who has worked at first IITRI and now IIT for 25 years. Tim gave me a thorough tour of both the IIT Tower and the buildings that connect to it, though 90% of the time I had no idea where I was. Although there are two levels of basement below the surface, there's not much beyond that unless you want to explore the sewer pit, and Tim's words of warning as I approached it (\"just watch out for the cockroaches as you get closer\") were enough to quell my desire to explore farther.I saw little to foster the rumors surrounding IITRI, though there was certainly a time when the suspicions would have been well founded. IITRI was once a hotbed of chemical, biological, and defense research, featuring everything from rocket propulsion systems to ejection seats.first made a name for itself in 1939, when the Snow Cruiser was unveiled. The government certainly took an interest in IIT during the Cold War years, as it fought to maintain dominance over the Soviet Union. The frantic pace of the space race is evidenced in this selection from the 1956 Annual Report of Armour Research Foundation:Apparently, the idea of one day relying on the Russians for our automotive and culinary needs helped urge our engineers and scientists forward. At one time, the cafeteria served approximately 1,400 meals a day\u2014breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Tim Hinko remembers, \"Everyone in IITRI, no matter what they did, had security clearances. Even with this clearance, there were rooms that had teletyping equipment, and they had to cover everything over with black tarp before we were allowed in. We had to sign in the exact time we walked into the room, and we had to sign back out when we left. No one was allowed in the room without one of the staff members who had higher security clearance than we did.\"Hinko also recalls seeing an infant cruise missile in the building, which might explain all those rumors about missile silos under the expressway across from the tower. They didn't exist, but what was beneath the Dan Ryan was a shooting range, connected to the tiny building at 3458 S. Federal by a tunnel that ran under the Metra tracks\u2014which would have made for an interesting lunch-hour getaway.Among the more innocuous research projects were the canoe tests conducted in the Life Sciences Building, which used to have a swimming pool in the basement. Basically, researchers spent their days dumping as much stuff as they could into the canoes to see how much weight it took to sink them. I want that job.was home to two spheres of high-pressure air. Jacques Cousteau used to visit Chicago to test his diving equipment in the spheres, since it was the only place where he could obtain precise calibrations. After the Cold War, one of the spheres was shipped off to Comiskey (now called U.S. Cellular; no mystery how that came about) and painted to look like a gigantic baseball. Its sister sphere was brought back to life during the Reagan years, when they sucked all the air out of it and used it as an atmospheric testing resource for Star Wars experiments. Everything old was new again.What none of my sources could neither confirm nor deny is that IITRI also serves as a safe house for the president of the United States if war happens to break out while he's visiting the Windy City. (Perhaps that would explain why the top three floors are blacked out\u2014to foil spy satellites?)The basement of IITRI is also rumored to be the home of a nuclear reactor that is cooled by the fountain in front of Perlstein Hall. This story actually appears to be close to the truth. IIT was indeed home to the first industrial nuclear reactor, but it was housed in IITRI's neighbor to the north, 3440 S. State (which is now suspiciously 3424 S. State).The building was designed specifically to house the reactor, which went \"critical\" on June 28, 1956. The press release from that day describes the value of peacetime nuclear research: \"Short-lived radioisotopes, useful in medical, industrial and scientific research, will be produced. Atomic fission, the 'splitting' of atoms which produces radioactivity and neutrons, takes place in the reactor core, a steel sphere one foot in diameter.\" The reactor resided there for two decades, until it was officially decommissioned in the mid 1970s, when experts finally decided that the risk of accidentally decimating the City of Chicago was too great.When the shield wall was being dismantled, the crew separated the lead bricks that comprised it into those above and below an acceptable level of radioactivity. Those glowing with life were disposed of (heaven knows where!), but the others were left lying around, much to the students' delight, and can still be seen serving as doorstops and decorative office pieces. One brick even lies in state in Machinery Hall in the office of David Schmidt, director of Environmental and Occupational Safety.Perhaps the only thing that excites IIT students more than the thought of getting into the IITRI basements is the thought of exploring the tunnels that run under most of the campus west of State Street. Mike Lynch, director of Facilities, led me and my trusty research crew on a thorough tour of the IIT tunnel system. I can sum up the tunnels in three words: confusing, dirty, and smelly. The tunnels now house much of the university's heating and cooling systems, and after I spent an hour down there, those three words applied to me as well. Originally built as safe, weather-proof conduits connecting the main buildings, through the years they were closed to IIT students and are now the domain of our proud Facilities staff. At one point on our tour, I was completely in the dark (can't-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark). As tantalizing as the tunnels may seem, I would advise against exploring them without a proper chaperone.IIT legends are not limited to unexplained mysteries\u2014some involve students with a little too much time on their hands. The Rock is one of the oldest fixtures on the IIT campus. In 1893, the Canadian Copper Company donated it to Armour Institute after its display at the Columbian exposition. \"Probation Rock,\" as it was once known, originally sat in front of the old Student Union building; when the campus was being redeveloped, the rock was moved to its current home in front of the HUB.There are conflicting opinions about its weight (somewhere between two and four tons) and about how much gold it contains (the original figure was $800 worth, but it may have appreciated in value to a few thousand). Common legend holds that one night in 1969 a group of fraternity brothers plotted to bury the rock by digging out the ground underneath it, says Schmidt (previously mentioned keeper of the \"atomic brick\"). He contends that the students were actually trying to remove the rock from the ground, but their inept digging buried it even farther. Whichever story is accurate, it is clear that there is much less rock to paint today than there was before the prank.A more successful attempt to remove an IIT landmark occurred in 2000, when a group of seniors transferred the famous Man on a Bench sculpture to a warmer and more comfortable spot\u2014President Lew Collens' desk chair. In recognition of the young men's ingenuity, President Collens had his photo taken with the silent man before having him returned to his proper seat on the bench to the east of the HUB.But perhaps the boldest prank took place more than a century ago, not long after the birth of Armour Tech. In 1901, J. Ogden Armour and his mother announced that they were presenting Armour Institute with a gift of $1 million. Pres. Frank J. Gunsaulus determined that the money would be added to the endowment to supplement tuition fees, since it was the intent of the school's founder to keep tuition low and education within reach of rich and poor students alike (tuition at the time was $75 per year).As you might expect, this decision was very popular with the students themselves, and on April 15, 1901, a group of about 100 took to the streets to celebrate the grand gift\u2014clad only in their nightshirts. The young men, who by this point had probably crossed over the line of sobriety, walked to the South Side \"El\" train at 33rd Street and pushed their way into the station without paying. They then boarded a train heading south and, for all intents and purposes, hijacked two of the cars. The other passengers evacuated, and the students ended up taking out all the light bulbs, breaking the windows, and generally making a mess. When they reached Stony Island, they still refused to leave or pay. The train crew turned back and headed north, but when they reached State and Van Buren, the fun was over.A police squad escorted the boys to the lock up. Armour's dean Victor C. Alderson came down to bail them out at 3 a.m., but the next morning they had to make their appearance in court. Public opinion was on their side, and the elevated railroad decided not to pursue the case. In James Clinton Peebles' A History of Armour Institute of Technology, he quotes one of the Chicago newspapers: \"There is nothing really harmful in these youngsters. They bathe regularly and wear clean linen\u2026Youth must have its fling and boys will be boys. There is nothing the matter with the Armour Institute boys. Please forgive them.\" The \"Nightshirt Parade\" will undoubtedly go down in IIT history as the ultimate joyride.Does your G.P.A. really drop a tenth of a point every time you walk under a passing \"El\" train? Does Mies van der Rohe breathe down the necks of architecture students in Crown Hall late at night? Just what is that on top of the power plant smokestack?Although we've tried to shed light on a few of IIT's popular urban legends, we hope you don't mind that we've left some shrouded in mystery. After all, the myths passed down from year to year are the legacies of inspired imaginations and part of the bond that IIT students share. Future graduates are already adding their own stories to this IIT lore, and the next generation will undoubtedly hear tales about the secret treasures discovered during excavation for the new campus center and residence hall. Whether old or new, truth or inspired fiction, these stories will remain a colorful part of IIT's rich history for many years to come."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/category/features?page=15", "content": "In the fall of 1957, two girls in their sophomore year at Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., passed notes to each other across the aisle of their classroom.

Chuck proved to be one of IIT's most generous and active supporters both financially and through his investment of time. Lew Collens, president of IIT, explains the Finkl/IIT friendship: IIT is indeed fortunate to have numbered among its alumni and friends such industry leaders as Chuck and his father Bill Finkl. A. Finkl & Sons has looked to IIT as a source of engineering talent for much of this century, and the Finkl family has been a great friend and benefactor of IIT over the same period.In 1943, Chuck earned a Bachelor of Science infrom IIT and in 1995 was awarded IIT's highest academic honor, the honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters and Science for a lifetime of contributions to industry and education. He passed away in November 2002.The Finkl family has played an active role in IIT history since the early 1900's, when Chuck's fatherforged the family's first link with the university as a student. During the course of his life, William Finkl gave more than $2.5 million to IIT, nearly half of which was used to create the William F. Finkl Interactive Instructional Television Network, (IIT/V), which provided technological education courses and degree programs to thousands of IIT students and employed professionals.William's 1976 gift launched IIT into the future. IIT/V was an important component of the Campaign for the Future of IIT, helping IIT become a dominant force in distance learning. In fact, IIT recently celebrated 25 years of distance learning in the Chicago region with the largest Chicago-area microwave delivery system. Today, IIT/V is part of IIT, which is now in its 5th year of Internet programming using streaming-video and audio with synchronized slides to reach students around the globe.Louise Hewitt, director of IIT Online Technical Services, explains the significance of IIT/V: William Finkl's charitable contribution allowed IIT to be the first in the Chicago area to wire the city to deliver advanced courses and we're proud of that fact. We broadcast about 110 live courses each semester and 30 each summer to hundreds of professionals right at their job sites. IIT Online and IIT/V play significant roles in attracting and retaining engineers and scientists as well as technology businesses in the Chicago area.Other family alumni include Chuck's brother, Anthony Finkl, who earned a Bachelor of Science inin 1941, and William's grandsons, David Marlett and Jonathon Finkl, both 1983 recipients of full Presidential Scholarships to IIT.For Chuck, the IIT/Finkl partnership was mutually beneficial. He believed in the value of an IIT education, and employed many IIT-trained engineers. IIT students were a true concern of Chuck's, and he often requested recent job placement statistics and participated in conversation events with students to discuss various aspects of professional life.Throughout Chuck's life he gave millions of dollars to help IIT maintain its high level of excellence, and actively supported IIT by donating his time to many IIT affiliations. Philip Nash, professor of, explains the role Chuck played: Chuck enabled the Center to interact with the manufacturing industry by recruiting new company members and support. He helped IIT forge relationships with many other industry leaders. Chuck's steadfast support allowed the Center to grow and flourish.In November 2002 at age 82, Charles W. Finkl passed away. In the wake of Chuck's death, Bruce Liimatainen, another alumnus of IIT, was named chairman and CEO of A. Finkl & Sons Company. Bruce is a 1974 mechanical engineering graduate, and, in 2002, was appointed to IIT's executive committee of the board of directors. He is also a member of the board of overseers at IIT's, and like Chuck, an enthusiastic supporter of the university. In 1994, for example, he presented the Liimatainen Lab Fund in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering to the school.Thanks to the visionary leadership and ongoing support through the years, the Finkl family has bestowed IIT with a series of long-lasting friendships. Chuck once summed up his commitment to IIT, \"My gift to the university is an investment in tomorrow's professionals, as well as a way of saying 'thank you' for the quality education I received at IIT.\"http://www.oit.doe.gov/working/fin_toolbook/case_studies2.shtml"}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2003/ethel-andrus-founder-aarp-iit-alum", "content": "While her name does not carry the instant recognition across campus that some of our others may enjoy, one of our many prominent Lewis Institute graduates is Ethel Percy Andrus. Andrus was the founder in 1947 of the(NRTA) and in 1958 of AARP (formerly the), and was honored by U.S. presidents for her work in the non-profit world.Andrus attended Lewis Institute from 1900 to 1901, receiving her Associate Degree upon completion of two years of study. Lewis was the first (and only, at that time) U.S. college to offer a degree-granting two-year program, and Andrus transferred to thewhere she completed the requirements for a Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B) degree in 1903.Upon leaving the University of Chicago, Andrus returned to Lewis Institute, this time as a faculty member. From 1903 to 1910, she was on the faculty teaching English. Her direct connection with Lewis ended in 1910, when, for health reasons, she returned to her native California. In a letter dated June 15, 1910, Andrus described how much she hated to write the letter that would sever her connection with her two \"greatest benefactors,\" George N. Carman and Edwin H. Lewis (the school's director and dean, respectively) and the institution that she holds dearest on earth. She wrote, \"I shall always hold dear the memory of the most generous and devoted director a school or faculty might have.\"Andrus' reputation at the school continued long after her departure and her career was heralded by those who watched her mature into a capable teacher and academic administrator.Andrus received an appointment atin Los Angeles and became acting principal in 1915. In February 1916, she was offered the position of vice principal at East Los Angeles High School, and in June was named principal. At age 32, she became the first woman high school principal in California.Lincoln High School's 2,500 students were mostly from poor families, representing a range of ethnicities and races who spoke 32 different languages. The school had one of the highest delinquency rates in the country. Andrus had a goal: \"To bring to each [student] a sense of his own worth by treating him with dignity and respect, by honoring his racial background not as a picturesque oddity, but as a valued contribution in the tapestry of American life.\" (January 1968, p. 25) Her volunteer work with the residents and clients at the Chicago Commons and Hull-House, while at IIT, had served her well as preparation for this.Andrus worked to instill in her students both a community spirit and \"the spirit of democracy\u2014the spirit of strenuous effort, the spirit of loyal and united support.\" (, January 1968, p. 17) She instituted school assemblies, sports events, dances and other social activities to try to break down the ethnic and cultural barriers separating students.As a result, the school's delinquency rate dropped dramatically. The County Judge of Juvenile Court awarded Dr. Andrus and her school a special citation for success in youth crime prevention. Years later, one student recalled, \"Somehow you found yourself acting the way she wanted you to.\"As a volunteer on the Welfare Committee of the, Andrus saw firsthand the economic plight of retired educators in the post-Depression era: pensions without automatic cost-of-living increases, loss of personal savings, lack of health insurance and deplorable living conditions. She was galvanized to action to advocate on behalf of these retired teachers, especially after discovering a retired teacher living in a chicken coop in a town outside of Los Angeles. Dr. Andrus' secretary, Virginia Schott, shared in a 2001 oral-history interview that, decades later, when remembering her discovery of this retired colleague living in such deplorable conditions, Dr. Andrus' anger was still keen.In October 1947, the National Retired Teachers Association (NRTA) was founded at a meeting of the California Retired Teachers Association in Berkeley. Andrus was elected NRTA president, a volunteer position. Andrus and her colleagues focused their legislative advocacy efforts on a campaign to eliminate mandatory retirement; gain access to health-care insurance for people over age 65; protect public employees, including teachers, from having their state and local pensions replaced with lower federal Social Security benefits; and gain exemption of retirement income from federal income tax.In 1950, NRTA won its first legislative battle. Legislation was passed that excluded members of existing state or local pension plans from the Social Security program. The fight to get health insurance for the retired teachers took longer. At the time, it was an accepted insurance industry standard that it was not fiscally sound to offer health insurance to anyone aged 65 or older. (Medicare would not become available until July 1, 1966.)Thousands of older Americans not eligible for NRTA membership contacted the Association wanting to know how they could obtain health insurance and other NRTA benefits if they were not retired teachers. Andrus worked with Davis to see if they could provide similar health insurance coverage for the general population of retired persons. They set out to start a new association.On July 1, 1958, AARP was incorporated in the District of Columbia. Its four official goals were to: 1) Enhance the quality of life for older persons, 2) Promote independence, dignity and purpose for older persons, 3) Lead in determining the role and place of older persons in society, and 4) Improve the image of aging. Andrus created the motto for AARP: \"To Serve, Not To Be Served.\"Andrus served as AARP's first president, a volunteer position, and as editor of AARP's magazine,, now known as. In that first issue, she stated her position on aging: \"Aging is not a problem; it represents a real and thrilling challenge. It is one thing to recognize that older people represent the nation's greatest single human resource available, and it is quite another to do something about it.\"Andrus was selected to serve on the national advisory committee for the first White House Conference on Aging, held in January 1961, near the end of President Eisenhower's term. Out of this national meeting came the impetus for final passage of Medicare and other important initiatives. Andrus received numerous awards and recognition during her life, including National Teacher of the Year from theand the(1954). She was the first teacher in the nation to receive the Golden Apple Award from the International Senior League (1954).In 1963, Andrus suffered a heart attack that her doctor believed would leave her unable to ever work again. But the next morning, she awakened early and asked for paper and pencil so she could write aeditorial. Soon, she was out of the hospital and back traveling, speaking and writing. On July 9, 1967, Andrus completed her last magazine editorial for the October-November issue of. She died of a heart attack four days later, at age 82, in Long Beach, California.President Lyndon Johnson wrote upon Andrus' death: \"The life of each citizen who seeks relentlessly to serve the national good is a most precious asset to this land. And the loss of such a citizen is a loss shared by every American. In Ethel Percy Andrus, humanity had a trusting and untiring friend. She has left us all poorer by her death. But by her enduring accomplishments, she has enriched not only us, but all succeeding generations of Americans.\"In 1968, AARP and NRTA published a collection of Andrus' editorials,. Among the testimonials, William D. Bechill, first Commissioner on Aging, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, wrote: \"Dr. Andrus was one of the first to realize that our nation was neither seriously facing the questions of meaningful use of the retirement years nor concerned enough with a place of respect and purpose of older people in the world around us. She was a pioneer in both organizational effort by older people themselves and in ideas for the advancement and enhancement of their personal status and prestige. And, she knew how to fight hard and be persistent about what she believed was right.\"In order to establish a living memorial to Andrus, AARP and NRTA approved a plan in 1968 for the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center at the. The agreement was that AARP and NRTA would raise $2 million and the university would match it. Within two years, the memorial fund had $2,750,000. The Andrus Gerontology Center opened in 1973. AARP honors Andrus' legacy with its annual AARP Andrus Award for Community Service, which recognizes outstanding AARP volunteers and members in every state who are making a difference in their communities.Today, the organization that Andrus founded represents more than 35 million members age 50+, about half of whom are working, either full- or part-time. AARP has staffed offices in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AARP continues to provide information and resources; engage in legislative, consumer and legal advocacy; assist members in serving their communities through volunteer opportunities; and offer a wide range of products and services for members through AARP Services, Inc. (ASI), a wholly owned subsidiary of AARP. The Association remains true to Andrus' vision of an organization that is a leader in positive social change and of individuals aging with dignity, independence and purpose."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2003/porter-w-johnson-and-physics-baseball", "content": "\"Most people have never met a scientist... and they have rarely appreciated the effect of science in their everyday lives.\"Like a utility player on a baseball team, Physics Professor Porter W. Johnson has done just about everything in his 34 years at IIT.He has taught, consulted and chaired three different IIT departments. He has published 72 scientific papers on topics from Tullio Regge amplitudes to quark masses. He has promoted science and math in Chicago-area high schools and encouraged teachers to add more science to their curriculums. And now, he is finishing the third part of a four-part book series on.But perhaps Johnson's most unique contribution to physics and IIT derives from a different passion\u2014his love of baseball. The physics of baseball, that is.Since his earliest days growing up in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Johnson says he's been fascinated by America's national pastime: its larger-than-life heroes such as Babe Ruth and; its panoply of statistics; and the scientific challenge of understanding baseball's mental and physical interaction.That passion grew out of the days when, as a young man, Johnson and friends were members of the Knothole Gang\u2014named after kids who watched minor league baseball games through knot holes in the outfield fence. He and Chattanooga chums used to attend local Southern League games of their minor league team, the Lookouts. And it was there that Johnson first had an inkling that the science of baseball was going to be part of his academic life. \"As a player, I was never that great,\" he says. \"But I realized that I looked at the game from a different perspective: the perspective of a scientist.\"Since then, baseball has become a cornerstone of Johnson's teaching and made him one of the foremost speakers and analysts on the physics of baseball. He has commented for newspapers and television, including recent chats with Chicago'sandchannels on thecorked bat controversy. \"I'm sure he made a mistake,\" says Johnson. But like a true scientist, he still gets excited explaining how a corked bat may be just as strong as a normal bat, but because it is lighter, a player can swing it faster.What's more, he likes to quote a line from the famous baseball movie \"Bull Durham\" to explain how the sport can be applied to science: \"Baseball requires nonlinear thinking.\" Rather than just marveling at the inexplicable skills of baseball players, that belief leads Johnson to ask questions like: How does a batter hit Randy Johnson's 96-mile per hour fastball? How does Sammy Sosa hit so many home runs? Why does the baseball fly farther in high altitude stadiums such as Denver? How didjudge the trajectory of a fly ball?Here's one example of Johnson's answers:\"The major league pitcher stands on the mound a distance somewhat less than 20 meters from the batter's box, and throws fastballs at a speed somewhat greater than 40 meters per second, so that the entire trip takes place in 0.4 to 0.5 seconds. The batter must decide in that brief instant whether, when, where and how to swing. Because of the influence of gravity, the baseball drops significantly from a projected straight-line path during its travel. The distance dropped is given by: d = 1/2gt2 = 1.2 meters \u2026 It is remarkable to me as a scientist that the batter can hit such a thrown baseball. Certainly, a person off the street would have trouble even seeing a major league fastball, although a significant 'hum' could be heard as it whizzes by!\"In addition, it's the deeply embedded tradition of baseball in American culture, Johnson says, that makes it a useful tool to explain complex theories. Especially for young people, Johnson views the sport as a metaphor to explain difficult, inanimate\u2014and supposedly boring\u2014theories of physics. \"Most people have never met a scientist,\" says Johnson. \"And they have rarely appreciated the effect of science in their everyday lives.\"When he began visiting local high schools around 1993 to help kids understand physics, Johnson says he needed a way to explain it in real-world terms. The result: he developed presentations that incorporated fun, simple baseball talks\u2014and found he had the rapt attention of the entire class. \"Physics is considered very hard,\" he says, \"The question is how do you take something that everybody is interested in and apply the rules of science.\"He adds that one positive side-effect of teaching the physics of baseball to young people is that, unlike cooking or golf, both the boys and the girls are intrigued. The reason: many girls have spent time watching boys play baseball, and macho boys don't want to appear less familiar with the game than the girls. \"Anyone who played baseball would be embarrassed not to know something,\" he says.Since then, Johnson has adapted to his presentation to many audiences. He has talked baseball to world-class scientists at theat the. This year, he worked with students and colleagues on an award-winning IIT Interprofessional Project to develop a map of, home of Johnson's favorite team, the Chicago White Sox. That's because White Sox executives wanted to know how far the home runs actually travel during the 2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game's Home Run Derby, a favorite event for baseball fans.And the sport still has an array of unsolved physics problems. \"Only one pitch has been really explained\u2014the knuckleball,\" Johnson says. That makes baseball an almost bottomless topic to bring scientists and students together to solve problems.As a director of both\u2014Science and Mathematics Initiative for Learning Enhancement, and\u2014Science and Mathematics through Application of Relevant Technology, Johnson also uses the physics of baseball to help teachers understand how to communicate the sciences better to their students. \"There are an endless variety of ideas associated with science,\" says Johnson. The, theand thecan be explained, in part, through the dynamics of a good curveball.Next up on Johnson's sports-and-physics agenda? After being invited last year by Web TV to analyze how physics played a role in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he thinks he may have a cold-weather candidate to match his presentations about baseball's \"boys of summer.\" \"There's lots of physics in hockey,\" he says with a chuckle."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2003/if-newborns-could-say-thank-you", "content": "There's a reason for the sentimental media stories you see about babies' lives being at danger or great medical risk: there's not much that tugs at the heartstrings like a small helpless human life imperiled. A recent alumnus of the(ID), Brian Stonecipher, has developed a groundbreaking new product, that has the potential to save lives.PediaPod started as a research and demonstration project for ID, which is worked on throughout the last year of the master's program. The device is a support accessory that holds pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization procedures, and its design keeps in mind the needs of both the patient and the medical support. Security is the most important feature of PediaPod; even though the baby is anesthetized, there may still be movement inadvertently, which can be very dangerous during catheterization procedures.PediaPod also provides a heating system for the patient. Infants lose body heat quickly, and catheterization labs can be cold. Ease of use for the baby was key indesign as well., since the product's user-friendliness from a design, perspective is just as much a part of any project at ID as its functionality. Students at the Institute of Design can work on product development in the healthcare, education, or transportation fields. Stonecipher was interested in getting into product development in the healthcare industry because he wanted to be in a hospital because of the complexity of the environment, it allows me to use my ergonomics degree there. The technology in the field is always developing too, and these developments really make a difference even if they aren't crucial, Stonecipher said.As part of the Research and Demonstration Project, students at the Institute of Design who choose to develop a product in the healthcare field have the opportunity to go toand find specific project areas they find interesting through observing procedures and questioning technicians, nurses, and physicians during a field observation. Stonecipher observed several adults and pediatric catheterization procedures and found that the patient holder being used during pediatric catheterizations was a product that needed improvement.The existing patent-holder is a plastic shell that does not fit many patients and is intended for a child larger than an infant. Stonecipher explained that the medical staff would often use pieces of foam and washcloths to properly fit an infant in the holder.Once Stonecipher had observed many catheterization processes and interviewed technicians and nurses and decided on what product to develop, he developed guidelines for what the product should have. During concept development, Stonecipher developed a framework of guidelines to address the problems of restraining the baby and keeping it warm. This was followed by behavioral prototyping, which is used to test how users would use the product when it does not yet exist.Once Stonecipher had observed many catheterization processes and interviewed technicians and nurses and decided on what product to develop, he developed guidelines for what the product should have. During concept development, Stonecipher developed a framework of guidelines to address the problems of restraining the baby and keeping it warm. This was followed by behavioral prototyping, which is used to test how users would use the product when it does not yet exist.Throughout the design process, students had several advisors working with them. Stonecipher worked most closely with Martin Thaler, Institute of Design faculty member and director of design at. Thaler was an ideal mentor for Stonecipher because he is a product designer and has done product development work with medical products. Thaler felt that there is a need for PediaPod and probably a niche in the market for it. Though PediaPod has not been taken to the final stage, Thaler said the next step is looking at the manufacturing aspect of the product.Even though PediaPod has not yet been commercialized, it is still getting the recognition it deserves. PediaPod won a gold medal in the 2002 IDEAs (Industrial Design Excellence Awards), one of the most important student competitions in industrial design. Stonecipher's gold medal is especially prestigious because IDEA, which is co-sponsored byand(Industrial Designers Society of America), awards only two students the gold medal each year.Stonecipher has a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from theand graduated in May 2001 from the Institute of Design with an M.S. in Human Factors Engineering. Stonecipher has no concrete plans for commercialization of PediaPod as of now, but is hopeful of getting it put into production. He also hopes to find employment in product development in the medical field, quite possibly achieving his wishes of making a difference through more efficient products."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2003/unleashing-blue-yonder", "content": "speaks fatalistically about his abnormal major when he was at, where he majored in English Literature from 1957 to 1960.

That's a must for the Air Force, which no longer is limited to conventional means such as long-range bombers and fighter jets, but has experienced a shift toward high-tech weapons such as unmanned spy planes, hypersonic missiles and ultra-sophisticated satellites in space. Roche hopes such gadgetry will combine to create what he calls an \"asymmetrical advantage\" for America's air and space power in the 21st century.A Chicago native, Roche became Air Force secretary in June 2001 after a fellow Chicagoan,, recommended him tofor the position. Roche is responsible for organizing, training, equipping and supporting the welfare of nearly 370,000 men and women on active duty; 180,000 members of theand; and 160,000 civilian employees. He handles an annual budget of about $68 billion.How would he describe his first year-and-a-half on the job?\"It's been jam-packed,\" he said emphatically. \"We've packed about three years of life into one year. The hours are long, and the intensity is high\u2014the war contributed to that. We're also trying to recover from a period when very few aircraft were built. The Air Force is aging, so we're trying to change how some people think about strategy for the Air Force, to make sure people are well prepared for combat, to be more efficient, and to deal with a defense industrial base that's dramatically consolidated.\"The \"war\" is America's war on terrorism. It was provoked by Islamic radicalism, a subject Roche was discussing with, a decorated Air Force pilot and Vietnam War POW, when the first plane smashed into theon the morning of September 11, 2001.Once the second plane hit the World Trade Center, Roche andAir Force Chief of Staff General John Jumper, knowing terrorists were perpetrating an attack, grabbed phones in the secretary's office to participate in a conference call with the Air Force Information Warfare Center at the Pentagon. They had no idea a third hijacked airliner was heading toward their side of the Pentagon, where the offices of Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are also located. The terrorists piloting American Airlines Flight 77 missed their target before veering around and careening into the opposite side of the mammoth, fortress-like structure, killing 190 people.His life spared, Roche proceeded to become a chief architect of America's rout of the Taliban regime\u2014which harbored Osama bin-Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attack\u2014in Afghanistan. He helped organize a near-perfect bombing campaign in which the Air Force flooded the skies with spy planes, drones, satellites and radar sensors transmitting real-time images to headquarters and bomber pilots seeking targets. The landscape below was so well-mapped that the enemy found it impossible to hide, even at night.Meanwhile, the secretary has been traversing the globe to visit U.S. military bases. His destinations have included sites in Europe, the Pacific, and those closer to America's military confrontation in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Pakistan. He defines the spirit and morale of U.S. military personnel to be \"quite remarkable,\" noting that they carry out their duties in a professional manner.\"There's much more a sense of purpose than emotionalism,\" he said. \"You'll see their determination now and then on the notes they'll write on bombs, but it's very pointed. There's a lot of empathy for the New York fire and police departments, and for their colleagues here at the Pentagon who were killed. But it's a cold, deliberate professionalism that's applied. Nobody's crazy. We haven't had any cowboys in the air, for instance.\"The air is not the domain where Roche applied his first professional stamp.

He retired as a captain in 1983.Roche, who lives near the, with his wife, Diane Lee Roche, denies being a Navy man at heart.\"I'm an American military officer first and foremost,\" he said. \"I was a Naval officer, and I had a wonderful career, and in the course of that I learned about the Air Force and came to admire a lot about it. I felt I had certain talents that, when combined with the talents of my Air Force colleagues, could help the Air Force as an institution to be a premier military force in the 21st century.\"Roche's knowledge of the Air Force is also rooted in his 17 years of experience in executive roles at California-based defense contractor, which specializes in air defense systems. He labored to devise and refine top-secret military technology, including the B-2, or \"Stealth,\" bomber.

He has developed search engine algorithms and specialized search tools used by giant companies such as,, and. He is the joint-holder of five different patents owned by theand, big defense contractor, and, a former research arm of the regional Bell companies. And he has nine more patent applications awaiting approval.Indeed, the 39-year-old computer wizard acknowledges that many of his search engine ideas-developed while at IIT, as well as in his days as a consultant to a variety of governmental agencies and contractors-are even used in places and for purposes that the U.S. government doesn't publicize. \"We've helped many commercial organizations and government bodies-both openly and in private.\"So, when lawyers from the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Hunton & Williams called him two years ago to consider testifying in a patent infringement case filed against e-commerce juggernaut, eBay Inc., their own search turned up an expert par excellence.As chief technical witness for the 176 patent in the case of, Frieder provided expert testimony that led to one of the largest payouts in an Internet patent infringement case since the web boom began in the late 1990s. And the aftershocks from the jury's decision are already affecting Frieder and his research at IIT.Here's how the case unfolded: In April 1995, a visionary inventor named Thomas Woolston applied for several so-called \"business-method\" patents: one that covered a process for listing goods for purchase in an online marketplace, and another which involved a means to search for that merchandise across different online marketplaces. \"Business-method\" patents, unlike patents that cover physical inventions, apply to a process-and critics contend that they inappropriately extend to basic business practices.Woolston says he came up with the idea after hearing a story on the radio about a Virginia-based baseball-card shop that was losing business as a result of the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. The problem, however, was that Woolston could never find venture capitalists to finance his dream project. Still, his patent was filed years beforebecame one of the most successful Internet companies-and his \"business-method\" for searching online marketplaces appeared to cover the technical processes of many e-commerce firms, such as GoTo.com and Half.com, that blossomed at the height of the go-go Internet era.As chief technical witness for the plaintiff, Frieder reviewed Woolston's patent application and concluded that, indeed, he had \"a vision of the Internet as this big electronic marketplace.\" His search methodology would enable buyers to move away from so-called \"catalogue\" purchasing, in which consumers can order from a list of products, but don't know if they are actually still available or if their price has changed. Instead, Woolston envisioned a process where buyers online could purchase a specific product and compare prices across marketplaces-and know that they would receive the exact product that they intended to buy.That \"business-method,\" Frieder says, is what eBay now provides. \"I believe that they are infringing,\" Frieder argues. Last month, a jury in federal court in Norfolk, Va. agreed with him. They found that Woolston's patent was infringed by eBay and awarded $35 million to the 40-year-old inventor, adding that eBay \"willfully\" infringed his patents. That finding might allow a judge to triple the $35 million jury award.Timothy Holbrook, an assistant professor of law at, who specializes in patents, agrees that the eBay decision bolsters the legal standing of \"business-method\" patents, although an appeal could still overturn the ruling. \"The decision is interesting in that a lot of people viewed eBay's process as pretty obvious,\" says Holbrook. However, \"the jury said the patents are valid.\"What's more, Holbrook, who tried many patent cases while in private legal practice, says Frieder probably played a critical role in the jury's decision. \"Expert technical witnesses are essential because you have to explain to the layman what the patent is,\" says Holbrook. \"You definitely need someone who is credible, intelligent, and also personable.\" To the jury, it seems, Frieder fit the billing.\"The size of the jury verdict shows how serious a problem we have in how the patent office is issuing business-method practices,\" says Henry Perritt, professor of law at Chicago-Kent. Despite recent amendments to patent law by Congress, Perritt thinks it may take action by the Supreme Court to reign in what he perceives to be business-method patenters run amok. \"There are people who lie in the weeds, file a business-method patent and then file for patent infringement,\" he adds.Expert witnesses such as Frieder are vital to the proper functioning of the U.S. legal system. According to Perrit, \"Almost any case of any patent significance relies on expert testimony.\"The effects of the ruling are already being felt. Frieder says he has turned down several new requests to act as an expert technical witness in other patent infringement cases. And, \"I've been offered many consulting jobs in the last month,\" he says. He doesn't have any current plans to leave IIT, he says. But after years in which his 14 approved and pending patents have been reaping benefits for the companies-like-that own them, he won't be giving up lucrative rights to future income. \"I was the fool who went for it,\" he says. \"That won't happen very much longer.\"But the larger impact of the eBay ruling, he says, is this: \"It legitimizes business-method patents and the notion of these patents on the Internet,\" he says. Despite critics who argue that \"business-method\" patents are excessively broad, and that a raft of lawsuits over such patent rights could stymie innovation, \"the ruling demonstrated that there are differences in business-method patents on the Internet,\" says Frieder.As a result, Frieder's own research may shift. After years conducting the typical \"deep but narrow\" academic research on subjects like algorithms, XML and text searches, \"it may now worth looking more at practice,\" he says. Specifically, the-trained PhD in computer science and engineering may focus on how Internet search technology ranks subjects or sorts them according to the relevance of the individual's search.It's those types of \"business-methods\" that could be valuable new inventions for the future of the Internet. After years in which Frieder didn't see a penny from any of his inventions-such as a search engine previously used by theand, a former unit of the, to disseminate information about alternative disease treatments-the eBay case has been a watershed for both \"business-method\" patent owners and Ophir Frieder.In the marketplace of ideas, Frieder's next invention could prove highly lucrative."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/winter-2003/all-glitters", "content": "\"I was just running down the corridor. I went to Dr. Perez and said 'It worked, it worked!' I was very happy.\"While burning one kind of fossil fuel,had an idea for cleaning up another.Khalili was in her car-with offices on,, and, the associate professor of environmental management is often in her car-when a casual memory sparked a key insight.Khalili had been looking for a way to remove more mercury, a toxic metal, from the exhaust gas of coal-burning power plants. She knew that mercury bonds easily to gold. She also knew that activated carbon-structurally modified charcoal-is used to capture particles and contaminants in many settings, from smokestacks to home filtration systems.Then Khalili remembered that in an ancient Indian culture, craftsmen applied a gold layer to statues by mixing carbon and gold in a very fine paste, applying it to the statue, and removing the carbon with heat. Khalili asked herself: What if, instead of plating the statue, the gold stuck to the carbon? And what if the gold-plated carbon formed a porous filter for power plant emissions, trapping mercury vapor but letting other gases flow through?Khalili does not spend much time pondering \"what if's.\" She formed a project team with graduate students and, assistant professor in chemical and environmental engineering. The researchers decided the idea had potential. There was one problem: There was no such thing as gold-plated carbon.Now there is. Last June Khalili's team filed for a patent to protect a novel process for manipulating the structure of activated carbon and plating its pores with gold in minimal, inexpensive and controllable amounts.Because the patent is pending, Khalili will not discuss details of the process, except to say that gold plating became possible once the team discovered a way to modify the surface of the carbon pores.The memory of the breakthrough makes her light up.\"Oh God, oh God, you have to see me that day,\" she says. \"Because we were trying and nothing was happening, basically.\"The team had experimented with one method after another. Then a graduate student of Khalili's walked into her office on Main Campus, and announced that their numerous attempts had finally hit the proverbial goldmine. Says Khalili: \"I was just running down the corridor. I went to Dr. Perez and said 'It worked, it worked!' I was very happy.\"Khalili's team had created a material that, used as a filter, removes nearly 100 percent of mercury from gas emissions. She says the process uses less than a third of the carbon, by weight, of existing mercury removal methods. Those methods have a maximum efficiency of about 98 percent, says Khalili.\"We are aiming for zero emission,\" she says.Because the gold is plated in a very thin layer, its cost is almost negligible. As a bonus, the filter can be recycled, and the trapped mercury recovered for use in other industrial processes.\"Suddenly, because of the specific structure, low cost, high efficiency, we applied for the patent and within one month the lawyer said, 'There's nothing such as this on the market.'\" Khalili's team has begun pilot scale testing of the process. The researchers are applying for grants from federal and state agencies to develop and evaluate the filter in true industrial conditions.The stakes are significant. Mercury from coal-fired power plants accounts for 70 percent of total mercury air pollution. Despite modern scrubbing methods, coal power plants release over 86,000 pounds of mercury every year. The metal accumulates in the food chain. Elevated levels can damage the central nervous system in humans, and has even been linked to autism.has identified mercury as the air pollutant of \"greatest potential concern\" to the environment and human health, and lawsuits have been filed against utilities because of it.Mercury has even been linked to autism, and lawsuits have been filed against utilities. Asked to comment on the technical issues of mercury removal, neitherutility norprovided spokespersons.Khalili hopes that what the utilities avoid publicly, they will embrace privately. She dreams of a future where no smokestack will be without a gold-carbon filter.And if that dream is shattered, she has another application in mind: removal of copper from tequila.But who wants their tequila less toxic?Better stick with power plants."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/category/features?page=13", "content": "Shelley Brown enjoyed two birthday cakes the year she was a freshman at Whitney M.

The general populace wanted to know all they could about both the history and background of those who might have perpetrated these crimes, as well as the details of the damage. Following the East Coast terrorist attacks, it was estimated that 100 million American sent or received e-mails related to the terrorist activity. Those who had friends, family, or co-workers who might have been in the, at the Pentagon, or on one of the hijacked planes, felt an even greater need for immediately uncovering the news.Increasingly, the primary news sources in times like these, is the Internet. Some go toor, and they go there first before they would actually go to a print edition of the, or turn on their TV and switch the channel to CNN.With increased security in every walk of life since the attacks, it is only natural that the Internet would be subject to the same strictures. Traditionally, the right to free speech has faced the strongest challenges during times of war. As a result, a number of Web sites, both related to terrorism and not, have been shut down or restricted by both government and commerce.\"To address the Internet issues raised by September 11th, you need a broad background understanding of both the e-commerce business context as well as the some of the technological underpinnings of the Internet.\"The key argument against such restrictions is that the populace becomes less informed about how their money is being spent, and less informed about environmental dangers in their own communities. \"It is important to note that there is nothing new here except a greater awareness of the Internet,\" says, director of \"The Internet after September 11,\" a certificate program at the. \"Compare a non-Internet free speech issue. Suppose I both publish a book that teaches people how to make a bomb, and put the same material on a web site. The government tries to ban the book and shut down the web site. The First Amendment free speech issues are the same in both cases. There is no difference just because the Web is involved in one case, nor is there a difference because of September 11, it's just that our sensitivity has changed.\"The certificate program is geared toward professionals working in law or business, and teaches a broad background behind the overall field of e-commerce. \"To address the Internet issues raised by September 11th, you need a broad background understanding of both the e-commerce business context as well as the some of the technological underpinnings of the Internet. You can't properly balance individual rights and concerns about privacy against increased security and effective government surveillance unless you know what is possible technologically and what e-commerce needs to flourish,\" Warner says in explanation of the program.The goal of the certificate program is to provide business professionals and lawyers a an education of the risks involved in e-commerce. The issues covered in the course that is co-taught by seven other Chicago-Kent professors under Warner's leadership include balancing increased security against both individual rights and increased costs, the role of intellectual property on the Internet, and the obligations of web sites and networks to control access, profitability, legal liability, and potential of excessive costs. \"One of the issues that was big, even before September 11, is where do we draw boundaries of Cyberspace? When do I have the right to tell you you cannot come into my web site? When do I have an obligation to exclude you from my Web site? After September 11 these boundary-drawing activities become even more critical. And, while some of the laws are new and the context might be a little different, this program should address the need of providing a background for the plusses and minuses of doing business in the online business world.\"Though this e-commerce program, formerly called \"Legal Aspects of E-Commerce,\" has existed at Chicago-Kent since the late 90s' Internet boom, the revised course will be changed due to the increased interest in security issues. As a result, IIT's law school has named this current version of the course \"The Internet after September 11.\" The weekly sessions are divided up into different professor's expertise, with Warner teaching about a third of the sessions. Contracting, rights to exclusion, security issues, intellectual property, privacy and consumer protection, and jurisdiction, for instance, are all divvied up among the team.E-commerce, and the Internet after September 11th in general, is in the national media spotlight regularly this year. Gregory Sidak, resident scholar at the, has written an essay on how September 11 will change constitutional law, and says that he doubts there will be legislation on Internet surveillance soon. \"All the heavy lifting in this issue will be done in the analysis of the means used to pursue the government's interest. The government's motive is obviously to prevent future attacks like the ones in New York and D.C. Whether their reactions are over-broad or not is going to be the real debate in the courts. This includes the rounding up of various Arab-Americans to imposing different screening methods at airports, to use of the Internet.\"Part of the reason that the legal community doesn't know exactly where this is going is that the Internet is viewed as being so much less regulated than other means of communication. This means that the themes for successful litigation in this field are going to be much more slippery than in other arenas. \"So far, it's looking more and more like courts might begin viewing cyberspace as though these virtual properties resemble real properties. So you could have a case where someone whose site gets busted for possibly abetting terrorism claims that these raiders were unwanted guests on his property,\" Sidak adds.But as far as e-commerce goes, Warner, who also teaches contracts at Chicago-Kent, doesn't believe that the Internet is as unregulated as people think, and that September 11 hasn't changed that. \"People think that it's the Wild West, but I think that's just a romantic notion,\" Warner says. \"But take any example of a commercial web site, like Borders Books and Music's Web site. Truth in advertising laws pertain to them just as they do in their traditional establishment that sells books in their stores. All the consumer protection laws pertain to their web site. It is simply false that web businesses are unregulated.\" There are also different state jurisdictional issues, having more to do with taxation, having to do with where the seller and buyer in an online transaction are located, as well as legal issues surrounding the use of communications in Cyberspace, such as mass e-mail distribution, or Spam.\"Spam e-mail is another example of extensive regulation. If I send you an e-mail that attempts to defraud you into giving me money, as many spam e-mails do, I have violated several laws,\" Warner says. One development that is new after September 11th is illustrated by the. It mandates a closer cooperation between the business and government than the business community would have tolerated prior to September 11th. The legislature will look more closely at Internet security, identification, and what kind of restrictions can be placed on service providers.Examples of this increased cooperation are plentiful both here and abroad. Azzam.com, for instance, was a site that provided news and information about Jihad and stories about martyrs killed in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya. Though it doesn't condone acts that are illegal, the web site noted that, according to Islamic tenets, \"martyrdom operations are permissible.\"Azzam.com was shut down this year by multiple Internet Service providers. According to the, a nonprofit group that monitors free speech issues in the Digital Age, at least one of these ISP shutdowns was in response to anrequest.In America, theand federal agents shut down the web site of 18-year old Sherman Austin. His site, Raisethefist.com, was an alternative media site that explored ideas related to anarchism, activism, and current events not reported by mainstream media. The site's publishing mode was an open forum for the public, and had housed information that some claimed could be used for the creation of explosive devices. This loaded site determined fully armed federal agents and policemen to confiscate some of Austin's property (namely, computers), and shut down the sites.But it's not just precautionary measures against privately managed sites that are being taken. Until September 11, locations and layout of presidential and military command centers were readily accessible on the World Wide Web, to which many experts cried foul. Much of the information would have remained classified in the pre-Internet age. Formerdirector, when told that details of military command centers were on the web, stated that they should never have been publicly available in the first place, and that even he had no idea that anyone with an Internet connection could access the information. Many of these Web sites were created by nonprofit groups, military buffs, and even the government itself. Since the terrorist attacks, some of the pages have been removed or shut down, but many remain.Since September 11, thehas taken down over 200 web pages that contained sensitive information about the White House and other facilities. A similar reassessment is taking place across government agencies. Sites that contain information that could be used by terrorists are being changed or are now requiring password entrance for information retrieval.The government has gotten in on the belt-tightening as well. Theshut down its Web site earlier this year, because it contained potentially damaging details about U.S. nuclear plants. Theno longer provides information about chemical plants' risk-management plans. Therecently restricted access to the, through their Office of Pipeline Safety. This system shows the locations of natural gas pipelines and, most critically, information about where pipeline leaks might put drinking water at risk. Theconducted a similar cloaking of one of their web sites, as well (it contained information about an underground military command center near the nation's capitol).Every element of the Internet has been affected in some way. Partly because of the heavy media consumption in the wake of the attacks, and partly because of the ineffectiveness of business to be able to make a profit off the Web, every major search engine has transitioned from a mere search engine to a portal. This means that in the days of the Internet gold rush, for instance, the search engines' home pages contained a box to find keywords that you would enter on a desired subject. Now, instead of a mere offer to search the World Wide Web based on keywords that you enter, these home pages are now filled with content. This branded content ranges from product links, advertisements, and, especially, news links.These changes in how the Internet behaves as well as how the legal aspects of the Internet are changing, makes the certificate program a constant site of evolution, according to Warner. \"Constant changing pattern in the laws, as well as in the technology make this a tough one to teach. As professors in the course, we all learn about this, and we have a remarkable group of people working on this; at the helm of this project alone we've got five or six people who are directly or indirectly working in the field, and it's pretty rare for an educational institution to have that.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2018/less-much-more", "content": "April high temperatures in Grand Marais, Minnesota, located on the shores of Lake Superior, average in the mid-40\u00b0F range, balmy by its January -40\u00b0F low that residents take in stride.

Construction began in 2017 with testing and evaluation slated for this year into early 2019, after which production will begin. Coulson's path to triple-zero and passive house design came early in her career as an architect working on the team that designed London's Swiss Re building, known affectionately asfor its characteristic shape. The building's client required that rigorous energy features be incorporated into its futuristic design and Coulson, missing the wilderness and lakes of her native Minnesota, returned home after a few years eager to employ the green architecture methods she expected were the norm everywhere. What she discovered was quite the opposite.\"I was shocked at how resistant both architects and engineers were to try to do anything innovative in terms of sustainability. This was a bit before LEED, but still, the idea of natural ventilation, passive strategies\u2026I was really disappointed,\" admits Coulson, who was back on Mies Campus last fall to attend a special event at the College of Architecture. \"To me, that was always what design excellence should be. I felt that area was a missing puzzle piece that I needed to learn more about and to develop the tools that I needed to do it myself.\"Coulson found a good fit at Salmela Architect, where she helped to design the award-winningat the University of Minnesota Duluth, a building anticipated to be the greenest on campus. Coincidentally, the North American Passive House Conference was being held in Duluth then. Coulson attended it and discovered her puzzle piece: training in the, an energy-modeling software program developed by the PHI that allows architects to ensure that all details of their design concepts meet passive house standards.\"Then it was feet in the fire,\" says Coulson, who immediately began applying what she learned to the Bagley project, which ultimately met passive house standards and became the first building at the university to be LEED-certified at the platinum level. In 2009 she opened her own firm and now proudly identifies as a passive house design rule breaker, a label she hopes more architects will one day wear.\"I feel that this is an opportunity for the architecture profession to invent new languages that are generated from modeling and experimentation. It's a fresh approach to context and climate,\" says Coulson, who won a 2016 Chicago Athenaeum Green Good Design Award for two COULSON designs, theand the Pays d'en Haut residence. \"By experimenting with the modeling, I've been blown away by what is plausible that I would have never guessed would work. One concern of the architecture industry as a whole is whether individuals are going to lose their creative freedom or the ability to create the emotional mood they want for the project. What I'm saying is, they won't.\"Last year COULSON was also recognized by the American Institute of Architects as one of six national architecture firms out of 175 participants to meet energy targets in the. The call to action is that new buildings, developments, and major renovations be carbon-neutral by 2030 and by 2015 achieve a 70-percent reduction in energy use.\"Carly is definitely a leading Passive House architect with a capital 'A,' so to speak,\" says Ken Levenson, architect, board member of the, and chief operating officer of 475 High Performance Building Supply. \"She's serious about the form making, beauty, and social impact of architecture\u2014as much as any architect practicing today.\u00a0Yet she also shows that sustainability need not impoverish these fundamental aspects. Indeed, she shows howcan be baked into the very DNA of building design and construction.\"The Passive House Institute was founded in 1996 by German physicist Wolfgang Feist and set the bar for the development of the passive house concept. A structure must meet detailed technical criteria in five areas to become a certified Passive House\u2014heating demand, cooling demand, energy demand, airtightness, and thermal comfort.\"Basically, I learned how to take a conservation-first approach,\" explains Carly Coulson about her Passive House training. \"It's all invisible, which is what I'm really excited about. It's in the insulation, it's in the air tightness, and it's the use of the sun. And it works. It's almost magical.\"She says that the high-performance building components available today in the Midwest are both impressive and affordable. Some that she utilizes in her projects include thin-film photovoltaic laminates, Larsen trusses to support super-insulated walls, all-glass triple-pane fa\u00e7ades, and closet-sized air-exchange systems. Architect Ken Levenson notes that while the relative costs of these features can vary a great deal, homebuyers should work with architects early on rather than retrofitting their homes later.\"If Passive House is as fundamental a requirement of success as having the right tile finishes, with an experienced team, then the 'upcharge' can be a trivial amount,\" he explains. \"Passive House, to be as cost-effective as possible, must be fully integrated on day one of the planning process.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/designing-stem-leaders", "content": "With its young upbeat staff and office decorated much like the dorm room of a socially conscious, world-traveling, leadership-savvy student, it's a wonder that the high schoolers who visit the home of thecan tear themselves away from its comfortable red couch and fake fur pillows.

Subway trains stopped in their tracks. Cell phones were silent in purses and pockets as exhausted workers maneuvered their way home, without the benefit of traffic lights, to check on their families. It was August 14, 2003, and in just nine seconds, one of the largest electricity blackouts in North American history had wiped out power across the northeastern United States and Ontario, Canada, leaving some in the dark for more than a week.But long after the lights were shining again, the subways were humming, and cell phones were ringing in every office and on every street corner, the more profound implications of this historic failure began to sink in as officials looked at the upgrades and new technologies that would be needed to offset an increasingly overburdened electrical energy system.The threat of future blackouts has not diminished as electricity demands continue to rise. And this year, another hot energy issue has affected vacation plans and pocketbooks across the nation. As gasoline prices have risen to an all-time high spurring political debates from the office watercooler to the floor of Congress a growing number of Americans are paying more attention to the economic, environmental, and political dangers of dependency on fossil fuels.These concerns have led policymakers to look more closely at, energy that can be produced economically and without adversely affecting the environment or well-being of future generations as an alternative to fossil fuels. Sustainable energy advocates emphasize the need to limit the use of non-renewable sources of energy and use more renewable sources, such as the sun, wind, and waves.IIT's research leadership in the field of sustainable energy dates back three decades.At that time, IIT was already an established national center of energy and power research, a field it entered in the 1950s after the university became affiliated with the(IGT, today known as the Gas Technology Institute after its merger with the Gas Research Institute in 2000). This allowed students and employees with IGT scholarships to complete degrees at IIT and connected IIT to cutting-edge energy research. Over the following decades, IIT developed additional energy research partnerships with organizations such as, the, and the.Many of IIT's energy-related efforts have been led by Henry Linden, Max McGraw Professor of Energy and Power Engineering and Management. Linden has worn many professional hats ranging from president of several energy research organizations to advisor to the Kennedy and Ford administrations on energy issues to distinguished professor to interim IIT president. Linden has developed a reputation over the past six decades as a leader in the global scientific community for his work in sustainable global energy systems, climate change, and industrial ecology.Linden believes in the potential of energy to affect positive global change. \"All advances in human, social well-being since the Industrial Revolution are a result of the substitution of commercial energy forms for human and animal labor,\" Linden says. \"This has led to the abolition of serfdom, slavery, child labor, and the subjugation of women.\" He adds, \"You can see how the cultural and social effects of energy abundance have benefited the human race.\"This quest to help ensure that the energy supply remains abundant and environmentally friendly led Linden to develop a sustainable energy paradigm based on the interdependent relationships between energy, the environment, and economics. This ''\u00a0paradigm has laid the groundwork for IIT's most recent research efforts.To fully address the E3 issue, in fall 2004 IIT brought together core strengths in engineering, science, design, architecture, business, law, and psychology under the umbrella of the Energy and Sustainability Institute (ESI). The institute's objective is to improve the quality of life while preserving natural resources and the environment for future generations.Co-founded by Max McGraw Professor of Energy, Environment, and Economics and IIT Armour College of Engineering Dean, who is currently serving as ESI's acting director, the institute is addressing issues in energy and sustainable development in partnership with government, industry, other universities, and the community. Arastoopour believes that only this type of collaborative approach will yield an effective, lasting energy system. \"If we want to do anything comprehensive, we have to reach out and have a partnership,\" says Arastoopour, \"not only with other universities but also with national labs and industry.\"The institute's sustainability initiatives are focused on two primary goals: one, to develop and apply conservation principles to decrease energy consumption and increase the efficiency of current energy sources; and two, to transition to less carbon-intensive energy supplies and move to hydrogen derived from wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources.In conjunction with this energy research, the institute is addressing power reliability and security issues, including electric grid modeling. Led by Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor, IIT's Grid Collapse Vulnerability Project aims to identify grid collapse vulnerabilities as the first stage in a comprehensive risk-reduction strategy for the electric power infrastructure helping to ensure that widespread failures like the blackout that struck North America in 2003 do not happen again. \"Current electric grid models for the U.S. are lacking either in geographical scope or technical detail,\" says Shahidehpour. \"Before we can propose effective strategies to improve the system, we must first identify its most severe vulnerabilities.\"Two projects currently taking place under the ESI umbrella are being developed by individuals who, by virtue of their age and education, may have unique potential to significantly impact the future of sustainable energy research IIT students.Through IIT's(IPRO) program and with the help of a $200,000 grant from thethis year, students have researched and designed plans for building a hydrogen-fueling station to power campus vehicles and a 'House of the Future' a living laboratory for energy-saving technologies developed at IIT. The house is the first step toward creating a 'Sustainable Village' on IIT's Main Campus powered entirely by clean energy from wind, solar, and fuel cell technologies. Students recently presented these projects to IIT administration, faculty, trustees, and community leaders at the spring 2005 IPRO Projects Day, and outlined a roadmap to sustainability for the entire IIT campus.After seeing the student demonstrations, IIT Vice President of External Affairswho has worked closely with the city to gain support for IIT's sustainability initiatives is confident that IIT students will have an important impact on the future of sustainable energy research. \"Our students have picked up on sustainable research and carried it farther,\" says Baker. \"They've taken our vision of IIT as an interprofessional, cutting-edge place, and run with it.\" Baker was particularly impressed with the Sustainable Village project, which included the students? plan for making the IIT campus 100 percent sustainable by the year 2040, saying, \"How far they took that project in one semester is just unbelievable.\"IIT's long history of pioneering clean energy technologies is not going unnoticed by the surrounding community. A group of IIT students led by IIT Associate Research Professor Said Al-Hallaj is currently assisting the City of Chicago in establishing progressive green building codes. The team was also selected last year by the Illinois Coalition to design a Renewable Hydrogen Fueling Station for the Rockford Airport.\"People want to work with us because we have been on the cutting edge of energy research for a long time,\" says Al-Hallaj, who coordinates IIT Renewable Energy Programs and also currently oversees IPROs focusing on IIT's Renewable Hydrogen Fueling Station and Sustainable Village.Efforts such as those by the City of Chicago advisory council illustrate a key point about which energy experts Linden and Arastoopour are both quick to remind people: The future of renewable energy lies in the hands of today's students. \"We must continue to produce engineers who specialize in energy technologies and who understand the associated environmental issues and economic forces that drive technology choices,\" says Arastoopour. \"The challenge and the opportunity is learning how to synthesize all of these factors to create a truly sustainable and secure future for generations to come.\"The university's sustainable energy efforts derive breadth and depth from an interprofessional approach that reaches across units and provides students with real-world opportunities to apply their knowledge.Benefiting from five decades of faculty leadership in energy research, Armour College of Engineering students study a wide range of sustainable energy issues, including thermal management problems in electrochemical systems, hydrogen generation and storage, fuel cell improvements, wind energy, and energy-efficient transportation systems and Armour's broadbased curriculum continues to responds to this rapidly changing field. For example, IIT's Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering teaming up with the Gas Technology Institute in 2003 resulted in IIT offering a master's of gas engineering degree. \"This new program will educate engineers capable of addressing the technical challenges during transition to a carbon-free energy society,\" says Dean Hamid Arastoopour.Armour also continues to provide students with unique opportunities to apply their knowledge through interprofessional projects ranging from hybrid electric vehicle design to plans for a sustainable campus.In conjunction with Armour, IIT's Stuart Graduate School of Business and College of Architecture are also providing leadership in sustainable energy education.Stuart Environmental Management Program Director George Nassos says that his students are excited to be moving into such a dynamic field and with good reason. Citing a March 21, 2005, article in Fortune magazine about the top jobs for the next 10 years, Nassos says, \"At the top of this list are environmental engineers who can prevent problems rather than simply control those that already exist. That is exactly what we are emphasizing in the Environmental Management program with courses that include sustainability.\"IIT's College of Architecture curriculum encourages students to consider energy sustainability issues, focusing on energy-conscious designs of buildings that are less dependent on fossil fuel-based energies. The college is currently partnering with the Energy and Sustainability Institute (ESI) on the 2005 House of the Future planning sessions. College of Architecture Dean Donna Robertson says that faculty throughout the college are bringing their knowledge of sustainable design to the classroom. \"Sustainable design has been mainstreamed in our curriculum,\" says Robertson. \"We have at least four studios each semester investigating some approach to this issue.\"IIT's College of Architecture faculty continue to pursue cutting-edge green design. For example, Adjunct Associate Professor Jeanne Gang and Visiting Assistant Professor Mark Schendel won the Ford Calumet Environmental Center design competition held in 2004 by Chicago's Department of Environment. Architecture faculty have also served as consultants, including Architecture Professor Mahjoub Elnimeiri and a group of doctoral students who executed a post-occupancy evaluation of several City of Chicago buildings such as the Department of Energy's Center for Green Technology to evaluate their energy strategies. The college is also encouraging international dialogue on the topic of sustainable energy design through conferences, such as last fall's successful symposium, \"2004 Sustainable Communities: Learning from the Dutch Experience.\"Stuart's Environmental Management Program is also helping to build a greener community through the Center for Sustainable Enterprise. Co-founded by Program Director George Nassos and Adjunct Professor John Paul Kusz in 2000, this resource center provides business, academic, and both governmental and non-governmental agencies with opportunities to collaborate on business strategies to advance the ecological and economic sustainability of the greater Chicago area.IIT energy pioneer Henry Linden advocates the concurrent development and adoption of several sustainable energy sources:According to the, coal, oil, and natural gas provide approximately 64 percent of the world's electrical power, and 85 percent of the world's total energy demands including heating, transport, electricity generation, and other uses.Burning these fossil fuels so named because they formed deep under the earth millions of years ago from the decomposition of plant and animal matter releases undesirable gases into the atmosphere:Fossil fuels are not a renewable energy source; once we use them, they're gone forever and the supply will eventually run out. U.S. consumption of fossil fuels has doubled since 1960.As IIT faculty make their mark in the field of sustainable energy research, they are also working with administration and students to create a sustainable environment on IIT's Main Campus, a project that is not without challenges.\"We really want to work on the university's energy budget, saving energy costs and introducing sustainable business practices,\" says David Baker. He acknowledges that doing so will not be easy or inexpensive. \"Our main problem is that we have buildings that are energy drains because they were built in the 1950s when energy was cheap,\" Baker explains. \"At the same time they are historic landmarks, so you are under constraints when you try to retrofit them.\"Financial assistance is helping to ease a few of those constraints. Through grants from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation and a loan from the City of Chicago, all lights in buildings on IIT's Main Campus are in the process of being replaced with energy-efficient lighting. According to Joseph Buri, IIT's associate vice president of facilities, real estate, and construction, the retrofitting is estimated to save approximately $330,000 per year.At the south end of campus, IIT is beginning an energy-saving facelift of a 135,000-square-foot chemistry research building originally built in the 1950s. This building, which will be part of IIT's new technology park, is designated for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification, a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings.IIT students play an important role in these and future sustainability efforts, as they study campus sustainability issues through IPRO projects and help to develop viable, energy-efficient solutions."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/practice-design", "content": "Moving from the corporate to the public and social sectors is the most recent step in the dynamic career of ID's newly appointed dean, Denis Weil (M.Des.

From the social sector, he brings the practice of collaborating with multiple stakeholders at Year Up, Sanergy, and Mercy Corps, and the belief that design is uniquely positioned to act as catalyst and facilitator for addressing the world's big challenges.When I decided on my \"next chapter,\" I had the urge to do something different. In 2005 I taught the first service-design class at ID together with Mark Jones from IDEO, and I discovered I like complexity and being on the frontier. The more complex application of service design is design for social innovation because it has multiple stakeholders, so I built credentials in that space. For six months in Kenya, I focused on building a more human-centered design capability for franchised latrines. The Sanergy project was the strongest experience I had of a service improving the quality of people's lives.I have an incredible passion for design, which is truly at an intersection today. Everybody wants design, particularly design linked to innovation. But because of its success, design, and particularly design thinking, is at risk of becoming a method used by any professional practice. If that happens, then design is not a critical professional practice anymore. We are the leading school for design as a leadership practice, and we have an opportunity to redefine design.Managing complexity\u2014A good example is our Center for Collaborative Healthcare Design. A recent ID project involved redesigning an asthma discharge document that emergency room departments give to caregivers of asthmatic children. The student team reconcepted the discharge process and changed the process from a text handout to a discharge conversation guide and at-home caregiving training tool.Directing creativity\u2014The role of the designer is shifting from being the magician and the creative person who comes up with the creative solutions in the studio to more of a facilitator. In the health care example, we're ideating with doctors and asking, how can we do this better?Mobilizing action\u2014Designers need to understand contextually the person they are trying to nudge. What kind of incentive is meaningful to that person? How do you drive behavior change? Design must and can play a major role in that.I've always loved to improve man-made things and processes. As a kid I redesigned my bedroom using plan views when I was bored in school. Every three months I rearranged my room. Living environment was very important to me, the aesthetic aspect but also the functional aspect, such as having the minimum number of steps from my desk to my bed. Today this interest has become my passion\u2014to increase the quotient of beauty and human dignity in everyday life. And this is what we also plan to do at ID: to expand the change we help drive in health care today to the other critical social domains of cities and food."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/down-to-the-earth", "content": "\"A new paradigm of long and narrow urban landscape projects are finding opportunistic lines through cities.

It is such a powerful space. With landscapes, I don't know that I could pick just one. Maybe it's sentimental, but I still like the forests where I grew up, in southern Indiana. They weren't natural forests; they were human managed.

It's not a nature-culture binary; we're actually just part of whatever it is that we are in our existence. There are two terms in Japan\u2014and\u2014one is the culture of people and one is the culture of nature. They are distinct but they are both cultures. Many cultures and individuals continue to struggle with that sense of integration of the human species into the presence of the other species, when it's really just part of the same thing\u2014not apart. This bias of the human condition has profound impacts on the world.Many of the twentieth-century landscape architects in the United States grew up in rural areas or on farms, as I did. That has changed in the same way that the demographics of America have changed. Now, our students are predominantly suburban or urban, and I think they're drawn to the profession through the social implications of public space and community building in addition to the environmental and social justice aspects of landscape architecture. I am hopeful to see how the urban environments of our contemporary generation of students will affect their work and advance the authority of landscape architects as the leaders of designing cities in the twenty-first century."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/powerful-passion", "content": "It was 1976 when a young college graduate boarded the first of the many crowded buses that would transport her from Venezuela to Chile.

President Barack Obama commuted his sentence in January 2017.At press date Puerto Rican citizens are scheduled to vote on a referendum that offers the options of statehood or independence/free association. \"Whatever the outcome of the vote, the point needs to be made that the U.S. Congress will decide the Island's status, not the Puerto Rican people,\" Power says.\"Puerto Rico is called either a commonwealth or a free associated state,\" says Power. \"I call it a constitutional anomaly that's really a colony. What happens in Puerto Rico is built on a history of what happens when people are conquered. It's very much about race and colonialism.\"Power notes that of far greater concern is the country's current economic crisis. The Island recently declared bankruptcy for the first time in its history. In addition, students at the University of Puerto Rico have declared a strike to protest cuts, and officials from other top universities have resigned in protest.In April Power traveled to Peru to research an upcoming book that will explore why Latin Americans in the '20s, '30s, '40s, and '50s advocated for Puerto Rico's independence and reincorporation into Latin America.

Part shelter and part school, Kranti is a home for women survivors of sex trafficking, daughters of sex workers, and young women who were born and raised in India's major red-light areas. Chaurasiya, one of 10 finalists for the $1 million 2016 Varkey Foundation, has developed a novel one-room schoolhouse curriculum tailored to her \"Krantikaries\" (from, the Hindi word for \"revolution\") ages 12\u201322 who differ by caste, education, literacy level, physical and mental abilities, and degree of victimization.\"The biggest thing that we tell our kids is that they are amazing and exceptional not in spite of their backgrounds but because of their backgrounds.\"\"The phrase that their local school teachers use on them is 'a whore's daughter can only be a whore,'\" says Chaurasiya, a youthful 32 who could pass for one of her kids, as she likes to call the 18 current residents of Kranti. \"The biggest thing that we tell our kids is that they are amazing and exceptional not in spite of their backgrounds but because of their backgrounds. The difficulties and adversities they have faced give them that extra grit and resilience, along with extra compassion.\"In fact, compassion, along with communication, community leadership, critical analysis, and creative thinking, are the five pillars supporting the Kranti way of life, says Chaurasiya, who spoke to a gathering in the Illinois Tech Department of Psychology in conjunction with receiving the International Award of Merit from the university in April. The Kranti school day runs from 8 a.m. to noon with 20-minute sessions as follows: yoga, meditation, journal writing or gratitude note writing, a creative-thinking activity (such as teams building objects out of marshmallows and toothpicks), logic puzzle work, and current events. The remaining two hours differ by day of the week\u2014Music Mondays, TED Talk Tuesdays, Worldly Wednesdays, Thinking Thursday (always a guest lecturer), and Field Trip Fridays (a career-exploration day, such as the girls working alongside trash pickers). From noon until 6 p.m., students take courses at mainstream schools or engage in dance, swimming, or more yoga and meditation. A cultural presentation or program to enhance the girls' computer skills takes place before dinner, which usually begins at 8 p.m.Chaurasiya also requires that each girl take travel opportunities to learn firsthand about the world outside of India and to redevelop their trust in people and reliance upon the goodwill of humankind. She put a 14-year-old deaf student on a plane to a summer camp in the U.S. with nothing more than flashcards with her name, important phrases, and symbols for Wi-Fi and money exchange. The young woman managed so well that she received a scholarship to the, a premier educational program in Washington, D.C. All Kranti students who are capable take a gap year to volunteer abroad. Chaurasiya believes that these global adventures will help her kids become better peer teachers and community leaders. The approach comes out of experiences that began while Chaurasiya was an Illinois Tech student. She spent each winter break traveling solo to other countries, such as Mexico and Uganda, to engage in socially relevant volunteer activities.\"Her double major in psychology and political science made sense to me, since she intended to change the world,\" says Emerita Professor of Psychology Margaret Huyck, who served as Chaurasiya's academic advisor when she came to Illinois Tech on a United States Air Force ROTC scholarship. \"I was adventurous and a boundary-tester for my cohort, but Robin is much more so. I admire that, particularly because I have always believed that her ignoring of boundaries was, and is, in the service of a mission for her life.\"But Huyck also says that Chaurasiya's noble ambitions had a dark side, fueled in part by outrage she felt from domestic abuse she suffered as a child and the treatment she received from the government when it learned she was a lesbian. Meditation retreats, psychotherapy, and years spent with her new Kranti family have helped Chaurasiya to grow and \"offer new opportunities in a context of love and acceptance.\"Normally animated and effusive when talking about her girls, Chaurasiya grows quiet when asked to describe herself. But her answer carries with it the confidence of one who knows that she is on the right personal path.\"If you had asked me this five years ago I would have said, I'm an activist and a human-rights whatever; now I would say I'm someone who is trying my best every day,\" she explains. \"I spent so many years thinking that I was going to fight and change the world, but the best thing I can do for the world is to change myself. I've also discovered that the best part about being a teacher is not what I teach but what I learn. Anyone who spends time with my kids and sees their positive energy and hears their laughter can look at their own life and realize the chance they have to be agents of happiness.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/pitroda-original", "content": "The white walls and white, plush wall-to-wall carpeting in Illinois Tech alumnus and telecommunications visionary's spacious rec room seems the perfect backdrop to showcase some 150 canvases that he created in vivid acrylic or oil-based paints. One, dated 1979, is of pop-culture icon Batman.\"My son, who was five years old at the time, was crying that he wanted a Batman toy from the store,\" says the charismatic Pitroda, who offers a visitor tea along with conversation at his Oak Brook home. \"It was snowing, so I told him, 'Let me instead draw one for you.'\"He leads the way upstairs to a hall where there rests an ornately carved chest stuffed with thousands of intricate doodle drawings in black and white, others in color. Pitroda, a self-taught, lifelong hobby artist, says that he has always been fixated on structure, geometry, form, and shape.\"Everything has to be straight and flat. If something is not in the middle, I will come and do this,\" he says, moving a decorative bowl to the center of a table adjacent to his home office, its walls filled with framed honors and at least a dozenof Pitroda with his characteristic mane of nape-length gray hair. \"If I am in a theater, I'll count all of the lights. If I go someplace else, I'll count all of the windows. I acquired the ability to scan everything. In that scan, I see images and figures.\"Pitroda's mind seems to move in as many directions as the swirls and vortices comprising his doodles, yet his calm demeanor and message today, at 75, centers on the philosophy of a historic figure who exemplified compassion, service to others, and right action.\"I grew up in India when it was just getting independence from Britain. In those days, we had nothing; I had never even seen a real toy. I never used a telephone before coming to America,\" recalls Pitroda, one of eight children. \"was the leader who focused on simplicity, absolute truth, nonviolence, and unconditional love for everyone and everything from animals to the environment to people. It was a way for people to come out of themselves and really live outside of their lives. I admired Gandhi's philosophy. That became the foundation of my life.\"Along with Pitroda's ability to scan and see images came his ability to imagine and see the future. Dubbed by the media over the course of his career as \"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,\" \",\" and \"Sam, Sam the Switching Man,\" Pitroda achieved global acclaim in the 1980s for his bold idea to fix India's sporadic or nonexistent telephone network, bridging the gap between the 800 million people in both urban and rural areas. He accomplished this through a customized digital telecom system of switches and exchanges built by Indian talent, not Western companies. Pitroda obtained a rare meeting with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi along with her son and future prime minister, Rajiv, and was given approval to establish the government-funded Centre for the Development of Telematics.gave Pitroda additional opportunities to further develop Indian telecom as a member of his cabinet, which culminated in Pitroda's subsequent idea to outfit popular public meeting places (think pre-Internet caf\u00e9s) with \"yellow box\" telephones managed by entrepreneurs who would receive a commission from each phone call made. These \"public call office\" phones would remain popular throughout the subcontinent until India's second telecom revolution\u2014the rise of mobile phones. An engaging writer, Pitroda (with David Chanoff) tells the story of his telecom experiences in the autobiography, published in 2015. Pitroda dedicates the book to Anu, with whom he has been married for 51 years, and his granddaughter, Aria, now 6.A self-described \"risk-taker,\" Pitroda admits that as a young man who was sometimes brash and na\u00efve, he had largely equated success and prosperity with earnings potential and set a goal to become a millionaire by age 40. He surpassed that goal at age 37, when Rockwell International acquired an electrical switching company he co-founded\u2014and Pitroda received a check for $2 million. That windfall allowed him the freedom to pursue his Indian telecom project and later, to develop the concept behind C-SAM, a mobile wallet and on-device solutions company that would bring him a second windfall when it was purchased by MasterCard in 2014.Pitroda co-founded several other high-tech startups and devotes most of his time today to writing books and undertaking roles in various international nonprofits. He is co-founder and chair of the, an organization that promotes collaborative innovation to build networks that deliver solutions to challenges facing Africa, Asia, and the United States. Pitroda also co-chairs the Paris-based, a \"think-and-do-tank\" focusing on at-scale urban development. Having come from a part of India prone to drought and often affected by food shortages, Pitroda established the, which oversees food banks in 11 regions.An Illinois Tech Alumni Medal winner and member of the Institute of Design Board of Advisors, he also helped to establish the university's online presence in India. Darsh T. Wasan, Distinguished Motorola Professor of Chemical Engineering and vice president for international affairs, met Pitroda (M.S. EE '66) during his student days and recognized his business acumen. Pitroda delivered the 2016 Darsh T. Wasan Lecture at Illinois Tech.\"Sam has always had great ideas and insights,\" says Wasan. \"He is really good at bringing people together.\"Through one book Pitroda is writing\u2014\u2014he hopes to inspire readers to apply some of those basic philosophical tenets that helped to shape his life. For starters, Pitroda suggests being open-minded and engaged with one another. He says that his wife recently hurt her knee and when the couple returned from a trip through O'Hare International Airport, a skycap pushed her in a wheelchair. Pitroda struck up a conversation with the young woman about her future career and before their paths diverged, he gave her his business card and urged her to call him for a networking meeting.\"That's what life is about; she felt like someone took an interest in her,\" says Pitroda. \"That's what Gandhi would also do.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/summer-2017/they-got-aim", "content": "With 14 seconds left in the game, fans in the courtside crowd at Penn State Fayette's Bryce Jordan Center were on their feet as opposing teams of student-athletes strategically positioned themselves on the polished basketball court in the March 4 event. During second 14, Illinois Tech guard #12, Quentin Forberg, leapt high to make his only basket of the game, one that he will likely never forget. His three-point shot will be remembered as the final points scored in an historic game for the Scarlet Hawks\u2014the team's first United States Collegiate Athletic Association Division Iqualification. Although Illinois Tech ultimately lost to the Concordia College Alabama Hornets, the true glory lies in the Hawks' journey and their supportive team-behind-the-team\u2014composed of a dedicated coach, loyal fans, family members, and a trio of creative data analysts.Men's Basketball Head Coach Todd Kelly knew that he faced a challenging situation when he came to Illinois Tech in 2014. Basketball had been reinstated as a varsity sport only two years earlier, and the majority of the 11-man team Kelly inherited had never even played high school basketball. During Kelly's first year, the Hawks won two games. Even with a core of power shooters such as Anders Bybjerg (BA '17), Samuel Rarick (EE/M.S. CE 5th year), and Vignesh Rajagopal (EE '17), Kelly was certain the team's 4\u201321 finish during the 2015\u201316 season simply did not reflect the players' full capabilities.The coach's frustration rose to the surface one day in late February 2016 as he walked through the Keating Sports Center weight room and noticed Rarick and another player studying the pulleys and iron stacks.\"I asked them what they were doing and they told me they were discussing the tension in the system,\" recalls Kelly. \"I immediately told them they should be lifting the weights, not trying to figure out how the machine works.\"After going back to his office, Kelly still had the two student-athletes on his mind when an energy-efficient lightbulb went off. For years he had been fascinated by the movieand the annual. Why not see if Illinois Tech's STEM-focused students could calculate some of the advanced statistics and player lineups used by the National Basketball Association and Division I teams to help the Hawks fly out of their slump?Kelly first discussed the idea with his wife, Adrianne, then met with Shlomo Engelson Argamon, professor of computer science and director of Illinois Tech's, who recommended his two sports-minded data analytics graduate students for the project: Denis Bajic (AMAT, CS '15), an analytics extrovert, and Larry Layne, his quieter counterpart who earned his first master's degree, in chemistry, from Carnegie Mellon University.\"Data analytics is much more challenging in basketball than in baseball, where it all started,\" Argamon explains. \"Baseball is a comparatively static, slow-moving game\u2014the effect of an individual player on what's going on in the game is relatively independent of what the other players are doing. In basketball there are multiple players on the court at the same time, the game moves very quickly, and there is a lot of interaction between the players. One player makes the basket, but the other players on the court can all influence the setup for that scoring. Those interactions make it much more complicated and difficult to calculate the kinds of statistics that are going to be helpful to a coach.\"Each week during their summer 2016 practicum, Bajic, who graduated from the master's program this May, and Layne met with Argamon and Kelly to discuss their findings. At the conclusion of the project, the duo provided Kelly not only with all of the statistics that he requested and more, but also the foundation for a creative complement: game simulations. Layne, a video game enthusiast, attempted simulations of future games to extract potentially useful information. He says that he logged so many computer hours analyzing Hawks players that at one point during the academic year he passed another student on Mies Campus who looked familiar, realizing afterward that he was one of the basketball players.Though the data science graduate students who helped give the student-athletes a game leg up had not met them (before thephoto that accompanies this article), their eagerness to become involved is one example of an esprit de corps moment, perhaps more meaningful than even a trophy. Rarick, one of five Hawks honored by the Association of Division III Independents (AD3I) this year, says the combined efforts provided players with a competitive edge.\"I am extremely thankful to those students who helped us out; I believe that data analytics can be a useful tool in preparing for games and devising strategies in-game,\" he says. \"Players learned one another's tendencies and grew as a cohesive unit. Using both data analytics to prepare and having good team cohesion only increased our chances of winning. I believe those are two integral factors into why we did well this season.\"Kelly, namedby the AD3I, recalls other moments, such as when his wife surprised him with a 1:30 a.m. knock on his hotel door the morning of the championship, having driven eight hours to join him in cheering on the Hawks. Kelly also thinks about the team's most dedicated, fist-pumping fan, basketball letterman John G. Olin (ME '61), Techhawks forward #43.\"When I look back on my own days on the basketball team, I recall the camaraderie and the teamwork. We also learned how to win, how to lose with poise, and how to lead,\" says Olin. \"Our team this year learned all of those things.\"Argamon, the basketball novice who admits to never having been a sports fan, describes the overall victory for the university community.\"We've contributed some insight from; Coach Kelly used that to motivate his players, improve their strategies, and take them to the next level,\" he says. \"There's a message here: Illinois Tech, historically, has emphasized interdisciplinary education and research\u2014it's how we do everything. This is a great success story for that way of approaching the world.\"Denis Bajic and Larry Layne tackled advanced sports statistics for the Scarlet Hawks, such as individual player efficiency ratings (a number that represents the sum total of a player's contributions to the team's wins) and adjusted plus/minus (a number that represents a player's effect on the game). Argamon says that to ensure the accuracy of their work, they also had to determine league statistics of the opposing teams, and thus spent hours poring over game logs, box scores, and play-by-plays to creatively estimate the necessary numbers. An insight their work yielded early on was that the worst players on the Scarlet Hawks were actually much worse in terms of the overall harm they were causing to the team.The analytics duo then drilled down to a deeper layer of analysis critical to an interactive sport like basketball\u2014calculating pair-wise synergies, the interactions between players on the court at the same time\u2014with an algorithm Bajic had developed. This would be helpful in determining the best five-man lineups for various situations, such as a three-point shooting lineup or the best defensive lineup.\"One of the formats that we got our data in was very peculiar and difficult to work with; it took a lot of time, patience, and playing around to get it to automate processing of the data,\" says Layne. \"It was definitely one of my top achievements.\"\"We wanted to uncover things that maybe we weren't so sure of or couldn't see based on the statistics we had to begin with,\" says Bajic. \"I feel that we've done something good for the team.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2017/volunteer-news", "content": "The mark of an Illinois Institute of Technology education stretches throughout the world and alumni around the globe demonstrate its influence every day.

It is modeled after the late American mythologist's iconic \"hero's journey\" story, about an individual undertaking a life adventure, obtaining a victory over crisis, and then returning home transformed.\"We use a lot of the principles and methods we teach in the traditional design process to help students understand career options, think about what they can do in the future, and challenge some of their orthodoxies,\" says IPRO Director, who co-teaches the course with Annie Littrell Senior and Tracy Skala from the. \"We have some students, who, from the day they start primary school, are told they are going to become doctors or engineers.

Before enrolling in the IPRO she had been designing flyers and posters as a volunteer for ICNA Relief Chicago. The intimate environment of the course gave Alexis the chance to learn about Azfar's creative efforts and he offered her the chance to design a mural for the relocated Idea Shop in IIT Tower.\"The idea was to create an art piece that would reflect the international diversity of Illinois Tech students and be an interesting attraction for new students,\" she explains. \"I never thought my doodles would work as a large-scale mural.\"Also, in her role as a peer career coach for Career Services, where she assists fellow students by reviewing resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and other documents, Azfar now better understands the process by which students can discover and manage their futures, by better understanding her own journey.Students in the IPRO course spend a fair amount of time reflecting, whether through directed discussion or activities that lead them through the stages of the hero's journey. One exercise gives students the chance to be a chief executive officer, a chief experience officer, and a chief technology officer to see which distinctively different role suits them better. Real-life leaders then visit with the students to answer their questions. In one of her exercises, Azfar and her IPRO team came up with the concept of \"fun zones\" within Career Services, such as a station where students can try their hands at making their own business cards, and is now working with Skala to further develop the idea.\"Not every student is going to benefit from this class or even need this type of class. But for students who may not exactly know what they're going to do next\u2014or who are perhaps so confident in what they are going to do next\u2014that this is a good way for them to be more considerate about that choice,\" says Alexis. \"It can help them to realize that career paths are not linear anymore; the world is changing.

My parents could've gone back after the first few difficult years, but they decided to make all of the sacrifices necessary so that my sisters and I could get educated here.During our walk we met with mostly staff of different representatives and legislators at the local, state, and federal levels. When we made it to Washington, we met with senators such as Dick Durbin and several representatives from across the country. Our notable meetings were with Valerie Jarrett, President Obama's closest advisor, and other White House staff. We presented more than 10,000 signed petitions advocating for administrative relief for undocumented youth. [The officials] insisted the president was powerless on the situation and that he could not override Congress, even though we knew it was under his purview to do so from constitutional immigration law professors. It was only until two years later in 2012 and under more political pressure that President Obama issued the Execution Action granting undocumented youth administrative relief under DACA.The walkers and I still keep in touch. I'm grateful to say that we're living very successful lives and are all involved in immigrant and LGBTQ issues to different degrees. Although my parents didn't raise my little sister and me to be activists ourselves, they were very aware politically and socially. My sister was named after Caroline Kennedy, and I knew of my parents' political inclinations from an early age. Part of the reason I became an activist and my understanding of my place in the world came out of a foundation that was laid at home.For a long time now, I have had a deep understanding of the importance of civic engagement, especially that of the civil rights movement in the U.S. There are so many important issues pertaining to our humanity and our well-being in general that if I can do my part by making our lives and society better, then why not participate? The difference you can make is incredible if you truly dedicate yourself to a cause or interest. I view it as my social responsibility for having the capacity that I have.These days I'm involved in different ways than when I was a college student. I am occasionally asked to write opinion pieces by outlets such asor I'm interviewed\u2014most notably by thethis past November after the election on being a DACA recipient and what it would mean if the Trump Administration would get rid of DACA.First, I would like readers to keep in mind how difficult it is for undocumented youth and their families to live in this country, and how much we contribute to the well-being of this population as generations of immigrants have done before us. Second, there many reasons\u2014push and pull factors\u2014that make us migrate and integrate our lives here, whether it be from fleeing violence or economic instability in our home countries, or countless other reasons. Third, be very aware and truly critical in thinking about the subject of immigration rather than listen to all of the anti-immigrant hysteria created about us. It's incredible but the same language and scapegoating that I heard from some of the KKK in Nahunta is very similar to what I hear national political figures ascribe to undocumented immigrants. Instead, get to know people that help immigrants for a living or talk to immigrants yourself to get a realistic sense of things and understand humanity better."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2017/class-notes", "content": "|||||||(ME '46), Shelby Township, Mich., enjoyed 50 years as a research engineer at Chrysler Corporation, then retired and began writing historical fiction stories based on his family's journey from New York to western Michigan in the early 1800s.

The sight of the generators, smokestacks, and spinning turbines along with conversations he had with his father made such a profound impact on Khaligh that he turned to constructing circuits and electronic components as an adolescent hobby. With an aptitude for mathematics and physics, Khaligh had scored an academic trifecta by the time he received his doctorate: He ranked first in both his bachelor's and master's power engineering programs at, and first in the Ph.D. qualifying examination in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Illinois Tech.\"As a Ph.D. student, he was able to co-author eight journal papers with six of them as the lead author,\" says, professor and Canada Excellence Research Chair in Hybrid Powertrain at McMaster University, who served as Khaligh's advisor during his former tenure at Illinois Tech. \"Dr. Khaligh is truly innovative, exceptionally hardworking, and a highly productive world-class researcher and educator.\"In a telephone conversation from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), where he serves as an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the, Khaligh says his achievements are the result of a simple formula.\"I work hard and always have faith in God,\" he says, adding that a little good luck doesn't hurt. \"Electrical engineering was the perfect subject for me. Some people oscillate around an axis, going back and forth between subjects. I knew what my passion was and wanted to get from this point to that point, so I worked hard.\"Recipient of a 2017 Illinois Tech Outstanding Young Alumnus Award, Khaligh has brought in more than $5 million in research funding for his power electronics converter projects as well as for projects on electric vehicles, energy harvesting, and undergraduate education programs since coming to UMD in 2011.\"The concepts that everybody is trying for in energy conversion are efficiency improvement, smaller size, and greater reliability,\" says Khaligh, whose team is preparing to deliver prototypes of an auxiliary power-supply device to, the culmination of a multiyear project. \"In an aircraft there are individual air-conditioning units, as well as TVs and screens used as infotainment that are all powered by auxiliary power supplies that are supplied by generators. We designed the power supply to convert the three-phase voltage from the generator to a low direct-current (DC) voltage to provide power to the auxiliary load on the plane. Traditionally this was done on a much bigger, heavier, and inefficient scale.\" The UMD team is also building a prototype of a new converter for electric cars that combines the chargers for the main 400-volt battery and the auxiliary 12-volt battery that powers the headlights, radio, fan, and other components, much like in a plane.Khaligh is also continuing two projects that he began at Illinois Tech while he was an assistant professor from 2007 to 2011: researching energy-harvesting systems and overseeing the(NSF)-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program that focuses on hybrid-electric vehicle technologies. Khaligh is an expert in the Energy, Power, Control, and Networks Program at the Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS), organizing panels and making funding decisions for grant proposals from universities across the country. Khaligh is contemplating his own team's future projects, thinking back to the power plant that played such a central role during his childhood.\"Transportation electrification is one of the inevitable ways of independence from oil. There are over 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the United States. More than 40 percent of greenhouse gas and 70 percent of emissions come from transportation, and for a long time transportation has been 99 percent dependent on only one source of fuel, which is petroleum,\" he says. \"Electrification of transportation will create new opportunities from reducing COemissions and reducing greenhouse gases, to new jobs for the next generation of engineers and scientists.

There, she made an observation that would eventually become the impetus for her,, published by MIT Press earlier this year. Although most of Hicks's co-workers were male, all the supervisors were female\u2014and from a different generation.\"Our bosses would tell us, 'You don't understand: Progress isn't linear...there used to be more women in the field,'\" says Hicks, now an assistant professor of history at Illinois Tech, whose courseis a first for the university. \"It made me wonder why that gendered labor flip occurred.\"Hicks's dissertation at Duke University, and later her book, explored how labor feminization and gendered technocracy caused Britain to go from being a world leader in computing to having a nearly extinct computer industry by the 1970s.Hicks decided against focusing on the computing industry in the United States, despite its own rich history of both advancement and\u2014sadly\u2014discrimination. \"Sometimes we learn more by going outside our comfort zone and out of the U.S. context and looking at what other nations have experienced,\" says Hicks.Britain's computer workforce consisted of women who carried out the daily operating, input, and programming work required to make government and industry run. Although today the importance of programming is understood, in computing's early days everything from punching to programming was viewed as low skill, and therefore considered \"women's work.\" Hicks explains that this discriminatory mindset was one of both gender and class.\"The idea was that working with these machines in this technical way wasn't intellectual, that it didn't require that much brain power,\" she says. Even the lowest-level workers, who punched data on cards, needed higher levels of education and skill than their employers imagined. Yet, they were paid little and treated poorly. When an eventual strike over their working conditions nearly shut down the British government, leaders began to more fully realize the importance of these jobs.At the same time, programming was also becoming recognized as high-level skilled work. \"As computing rose in status, the work wasn't changing, but women were getting pushed out of the field because of the belief that it was now important enough for men to do,\" says Hicks.By the 1960s and 1970s, the jobs were becoming male-identified and computing experienced a gender flip. Hicks explains that despite similar discriminatory practices, Britain's computing industry was \"a huge failure story\" compared to that of the United States because the United Kingdom had a far smaller labor force to insulate it from the results of its bad decisions. The United States, however, was still negatively affected by discrimination.\"You see this in Margot Shetterly's book,\" says Hicks, noting that Shetterly endorsed. \"If the U.S. had allowed all of the incredible black women who were so important to NASA's success to work to their full potential, we may well have been able to do better than eke out a late win in the space race. Think of all the many black women and men who never even got the chance to contribute because they could not work in their chosen fields.\"Hicks sees the U.S. as being just steps behind the U.K. historically and hopes that her book can provide a cautionary tale for the computing industry.\"I make a big point in the book about how discrimination wrecks economies. Britain and its waning empire\u2014we're kind of a redux. It would be smart for us to look at the similarities,\" she says.Hicks's second book shifts focus to the transgender population in the U.K. in the 1950s through the 1970s and how large state systems, such as health care and welfare, form people's identities. This happens not only by the way these systems will and won't describe people on official documents, for example, but also by how those affected push back against discrimination."}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/spring-2018/making-waves", "content": "Kyllian Griffin, head coach of the Scarlet Hawks men's and women's swimming and diving teams, says that the student-athletes' combined success at the 2018 Liberal Arts Championships came down to one simple reason.\"We work really hard,\" says the Appleton, Wisconsin, native, adding that all of their efforts in the water comes down to February, the month of the end-of-season championship meet, held at Luther College Aquatic Center in Decorah, Iowa. The men's team placed third; the Lady Scarlet Hawks placed fourth, just two points behind the third-place team and five points behind the second. The women's 200-yard medley relay team\u00a0set the school record with a time of 1:49.67.Griffin, who completed his fourth swim season at Illinois Tech, notes that the university was such a good fit for him because the student-athletes seem naturally driven to be at the top of their game, both in the water and out of it. \"We don't back off during the season. They understand that they have to put in the effort to the best of their ability as often as they can,\" he says. \"In swimming and diving, if a student-athlete is not having a good individual race, it's all over; no one can pick up the slack. They also have to be mentally tough.\"Griffin's coaching style grew out of the hard work he put in as a student-athlete at Lawrence University, where he was a two-time Midwest Conference champion and a 19-time conference finalist.

The voice of one member, Nestor Zaluzec (PHYS '73)\u2014senior scientist, inventor, and educator\u2014booms out over the sound of equipment as he leads the way next door to the significantly quieter confines of the Sub-\u00c5ngstrom Microscopy Microanalysis Laboratory, or S\u00c5MMLab. As Zaluzec unlocks the facility, which sits on a 100-ton concrete base, he can barely contain his excitement. Within S\u00c5MMLab, part of the ANL Center for Nanoscale Materials, is the $8 million ArgonneFEI Titan, or ACAT. But the building's design is meant to convey even more to come. It is being readied for the arrival of the ng-AEM\u2014\"the world's highest-resolution, highest-sensitivity analytical electron microscope\"\u2014slated for delivery in 2018.\"S\u00c5MMLab was specifically built to house the next generation of subatomic resolution instrument, and concepts from it have been adopted in other laboratories around the world,\" says Zaluzec. A member of ANL's Photon Sciences Division, he is a principal figure in the design and implementation of the ng-AEM as well as related scientific instruments and resources at ANL. He notes that S\u00c5MMLab, which he describes as a \"building inside a building inside a building,\" was an ANL design/build team effort, and its performance has surpassed the team's design goals. Upon entering one of the microscope rooms, Zaluzec points out waffle-padded walls that resemble a car's radiator, designed to cool yet minimize the perturbing effects of air flow.\"Each room also has its own vibration-isolation control zone\u2014the microscopes are vibration-isolated from the walls, which are vibration-isolated from the floors, which are vibration-isolated from each area,\" he explains. \"The rebar used in construction of the floor is made of fiberglass because normal steel material is potentially electromagnetic and can create ground loops and fields. Surrounding the edges of the concrete are two additional vibration-isolation materials\u2014neoprene and foam. Stray external electromagnetic fields in S\u00c5MMLab were low enough that monitors were even able to detect the streetlights turning on and off during commissioning, while the acoustic noise/vibration isolation is under 30 decibels.\"ACAT allows researchers to study materials at a resolution of less than 1 \u00c5ngstrom; observing and studying atoms in materials is a routine task in this research instrument. For perspective, imagine that there are about 254 million \u00c5ngstroms in one inch and that one million \u00c5ngstroms make up the thickness of a sheet of paper. ACAT was the result of a 2004(DOE) project involving a team of national microscopy experts and industry partners FEI and CEOS, and was tailored to examine nanomaterials such as metals, ceramics, catalysts, semiconductors, and superconductors, all at atomic resolution. Zaluzec and other members of the DOE team worked together to design and build the world's first chromatic and spherical aberration-corrected instrument. The, the device that enabled ACAT to currently be the world's highest-resolution microscope, is a series of specially designed electromagnetic and electrostatic lenses, and adjusts for optical limitations typically present in all electron microscopes. ACAT, which is part of ANL's suite of DOE national, is accessible to all members of the scientific research and education community.Another first for Zaluzec's research group and implemented in the new generation of electron microscopes is the ability to simultaneously examine and chemically analyze by X-ray spectroscopy nanoscale specimens undergoing dynamic processes in liquids and gases. This was previously impossible in electron microscopes because they utilize a vacuum chamber to eliminate air molecules from interfering with the specimen.The ng-AEM \"will not only reach resolutions exceeding ACAT but will also include ultrahigh-spatial resolution spectroscopy and diffraction. It will have a sub-\u00c5ngstrom probe as well as the highest-efficiency detectors in the world,\" he says, adding that the new microscope will be ideal for extending into the realm of soft matter such as polymers, biological systems, and molecular materials, fields into which Zaluzec is expanding his research interests and efforts.\"We're developing new technologies and methodologies to study nanomaterials in their native states and/or environments\u2014to study and to ultimately understand how they move, evolve, grow, and change over time,\" says Zaluzec. \"In situ, dynamic, and having atomic-level elemental/chemical sensitivity\u2014that is the next frontier for understanding materials and their properties. And at ANL we will keep pushing that agenda forward, many times at the bleeding edges of R&D.\"The South Side Chicago native says he knew that science was his calling as early as the fourth grade at Oliver Hazard Perry School. But Zaluzec discovered his true niche years later when he obtained a part-time job at the Sherwin-Williams Research Center. Already an Illinois Tech student, he was hired to wash test tubes until managers learned that he had programmed a new calculating machine during his free time to do his homework; Zaluzec was quickly reassigned to tackle analytical challenges. Curious about the light qualities of paint, he designed and built a spectrogoniophotometer dubbed \"The Nestorometer\" by the Sherwin-Williams lab team.\"That's where my physics came in,\" he says about his academic foundation at Illinois Tech, where, as an adjunct faculty member in the 1980s, he also taught electron microscopy courses. \"I had a lot of great professors at IIT, including Earl Zwicker, Fred Ernst, and Tom Erber.\"Word of Zaluzec's prowess as an inventor and problem solver quickly spread throughout the materials sciences community. He was offered a full scholarship to the graduate program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he received a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering and collaborated with acclaimed metallurgist. Zaluzec also was honored with thefrom, and continues to be a fellow there and in the Computation Institute, established by Argonne and the University of Chicago. In his more than 30-year career, Zaluzec has been recognized with numerous national and international awards, the most recent being the(MSA) 2017 Distinguished Scientist Award for Physical Sciences.\"Nestor Zaluzec's career has been distinguished by his early recognition and implementation of new technologies and techniques that impact the microscopy field,\" says Ian M. Anderson, MSA president, noting that Zaluzec's contributions include the incorporation of compositional and chemical imaging within a transmission electron microscope (TEM), the early theoretical basis for X-ray spectroscopy in the TEM, and the interpretation of spectra to quantify the composition of nanometer-scale volumes of a specimen. \"Even as a high school student, Nestor showed a keen interest in the use of computer technology, and another hallmark of his career was the interfacing of computers and information technology to the electron microscope. A signature accomplishment was the development of what Nestor called the 'telepresence microscopy collaboratory,' which enabled the control of microscopy equipment over the Internet, as well as the use of Internet technology for remote collaboration.\"His outreach extends to aspiring scientists. Zaluzec is a member of the Illinois Junior Academy of Science and participates in state and regional science fairs for middle and high school students. Through Argonne he currently hosts the website, which gives viewers the chance to use a \"virtual microscope\" to identify objects at high magnification.\"I do what I do because not only is it important to solve vexing problems in today's complex and technologically demanding society, but it's also admittedly fun. I get a little bit of a physical high in the sense that I've answered a question and solved a problem. I feel really good about it! And then, it's like, okay\u2014what are we going to do tomorrow?\" says Zaluzec, a youthful joy in his voice. \"We need to pass this excitement on to the next generation of scientists.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2017/people-will-prevail", "content": "For Carolyn Shapiro, Chicago-Kent College of Law associate professor, the words \"we the people\"\u2014the same words that begin the United States Constitution\u2014seem to define her life.Even before she entered law school, Shapiro knew that she wanted to assist people in ways that were impactful and lasting. She first thought about a career in social services. After college she worked forand for what is now, advocating for affordable quality child care for low-income and working families. As she became more involved in advocacy and policy issues, she pursued both a master's degree at the University of Chicago Harris Graduate School of Public Policy and a juris doctor at the University of Chicago Law School, which is where she discovered her passion for constitutional law.\"I'm interested in the commitments we make to each other as citizens of the same country, as members of the same polity,\" she says. \"I'm interested in how we navigate our differences.\"After graduation she clerked forand also former Chief Judge Richard A. Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who retired in 2017. She says that her year clerking for Breyer, who was then relatively new to the Supreme Court, gave her much insight on what makes for a good justice and how the U.S. Constitution should serve as the country's \"rules of the road.\" Shapiro returned to Chicago as a Skadden Fellow in public interest followed by a job with the civil rights firm, where she became acquainted with fellow attorney and state senator Barack Obama.After spending one year as a visiting professor at Chicago-Kent, Shapiro became a tenure-track faculty member in 2004. \u00a0Even within the classroom setting, she continued her efforts for the people. Shapiro says that one reason she has been so fortunate throughout her career path is that most of her jobs have allowed her to have a meaningful personal life.\"As a law professor I try to be a role model for people who have families,\" she says, describing her life with teenage sons, Jonah and Gabriel, and her attorney husband, Joshua Karsh. \"I care a lot about issues related to work-family balance and have taught courses in this area because we as a society are still struggling with it.\"In 2010 Shapiro founded the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States (), to promote education and dialogue about the Supreme Court. ISCOTUS, which Shapiro now co-directs with her Chicago-Kent colleague Christopher Schmidt, regularly partners withto provide programming for high school students and teachers. It also hosts speakers and symposia at Chicago-Kent. Shapiro is now a recognized scholar and Supreme Court expert whose opinions and comments are featured in both local and national media outlets, from WTTW'sto the. She also blogs onand contributes to theas well as the\"The Supreme Court is completely relevant today, incredibly important,\" says Shapiro, noting the court's involvement in the travel ban initiated by President Donald J. Trump and the ruling of marriage equality as the law of the land as required by the 14th Amendment.\"They approach these cases with a philosophy about the Constitution, how to balance competing interests and how to balance aspects of the Constitution that are in tension with each other. They also consider how to resolve ambiguity in the Constitution, of which there is plenty, and how to apply very general constitutional language to circumstances that nobody could have possibly anticipated when it was written or the amendments were written.\"This past March ISCOTUS held a program for high school students that featured the case of the(USPTO) vs. Simon Tam of the Asian-American band, who had petitioned the court to allow the band to register the name. The USPTO denied the request because it maintained that the name was derogatory to \"persons of Asian descent.\" Tam spoke to the students via Skype about why keeping the name was important to him. (In June the court ruled in favor of Tam.) This fall Shapiro also arranged for\u2014whom Shapiro describes as being an inspiration and \"the best teacher I've ever had\"\u2014to speak at Chicago-Kent.Kagan's visit caps Shapiro's return to the university after a two-and-a-half year hiatus (2014\u201316) as Illinois solicitor general, a position that allowed her to maximize her public service efforts. She reviewed the civil appeals and criminal appeals briefs filed in the Illinois Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals (Chicago), and the U.S. Supreme Court by the more than 40 attorneys representing the state. She herself filed briefs and argued on behalf of the state in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Illinois Supreme Court, and both state and federal courts of appeals. In 2017 Shapiro was also honored by the Chicago Lawyer Chapter of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy with an Abner Mikva Award for advancing the progressive mission of the organization.\"In addition to her extensive depth of knowledge of the law and exceptional experience with the U.S. Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Carolyn brought a strong passion for public service to our office,\" says. \"I was confident the people of Illinois would greatly benefit from her expertise and dedication to seeing that Illinois law was upheld for all residents.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2017/moral-compass", "content": "Michael Davis, Illinois Tech professor of philosophy, considers today's super-sized America before answering the question: Does our country need ethics guidance now more than ever before?\"We live within an enormously complicated system\u2014there are 300 million of us whereas in 1900 there were 75 million. Corporations are much bigger and divided up in ways that are different than they used to be. Products are more sophisticated. And much of what we do now is invisible,\" he explains, sharing an anecdote about his first job hand-developing photographs, nearly five decades ago. \"Most of what I used to do is now inside this, along with the camera itself,\" he adds, pointing to his smart phone. \"Most of what makes this such a valuable thing is in the minds of the people who laid out the design. If you have so much invisible quality, you're really more dependent upon people than you used to be. And if we are, then their ethics is more important.\"Equally invisible to the average person and perhaps less accessible than the concept of a smart phone's capabilities is genetic editing via, a method that cuts and replaces DNA at precise locations in a cell. In August a study was published in the journalby a team of researchers from the United States, China, and South Korea who corrected the mutated gene behind the disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in human embryos. This scientific breakthrough raised numerous ethical concerns on the already controversial subject of human genetic engineering. The ethical implications of such emerging technologies comprise an area in which the(CSEP) at Illinois Tech and faculty associates are working to establish ethical guidelines.Bioethicist Elisabeth Hildt heads the center, which has been a touchstone for many in the ethics community-at-large since its establishment in 1976. Former head of the Research Group on Neuroethics/Neurophilosophy at the(Germany), Hildt says that CSEP's Ethics Code Collection, which Librarian and Information Researcher Kelly Laas compiled from some 1,500 organizations, is an especially valuable resource for today's ethical challenges. It is the largest database of individual codes of ethics and guidelines in the world.\"Ethics codes and guidelines offer a huge opportunity to shape technology development, not just to recommend individual or company behavior. They can help to provide direction on whether or not humans should be cloned or on the use of CRISPR and similar technologies, where modifications can be made to the genetic endowment of an organism,\" says Hildt. \"What does it mean to have something implanted in your brain? Is there a way to manipulate people through it? What do people think about having different types of technology in their bodies? Do we really want this?\"Shortly after her arrival on campus in 2014, Hildt and postdoctoral student Geoff Holtzman began a two-year project funded by the Swissthat examined the ways that neuroscience and ethics intersect. Last year they organized the symposiumdrawing experts from around the country. And earlier this year,a book that Hildt co-edited, was published.\"We've been gratified that the center's approach has been recognized as one of the best practices in ethics education.\"\u2014Kelly LaasEngineering, genetic or otherwise, has been a mainstay of the Ethics Center, in particular since 1987, when the late Vivian Weil came on board as director. An Illinois Tech philosophy faculty member for more than 40 years, Weil, along with Davis and Robert Ladenson, emeritus faculty associate, initiated a CSEP landmark program that many colleges and universities around the country have copied: Ethics Across the Curriculum.\"One thing that made the center work is that we focused on issues that the university was very much interested in, like engineering ethics,\" Davis, CSEP senior fellow, explains. \"The reason we did Ethics Across the Curriculum was that a couple of mechanical engineering faculty wanted to integrate ethics into their classes. We had nothing that was suitable for them so we spent a year developing materials they could use.\"Initially taught to Illinois Tech faculty, the(NSF)-funded curriculum was soon offered to faculty from other institutions who spent two weeks during the summer on Mies Campus learning how to integrate ethics into their technical courses. Davis says that each participant came away with either a case study, module, or lesson plan to use in the classroom as well as to share with their fellow faculty. Before it concluded in 2016, the program was incorporated into ethics teaching by domestic and international schools alike.Laas says that a partial list of these schools would include Purdue University, the Colorado School of Mines, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Laas, who has done drop-in ethics instruction for Lewis College of Human Sciences, Armour College of Engineering, and the College of Science, says that the center's goal has always been to have the faculty commit to teaching ethics.\"Although dedicated ethics courses are offered at the university (engineering ethics, architectural ethics, and business ethics), the center prefers a true integration into most any course within any discipline,\" she says. \"Also, the NSF is no longer offering funding for stand-alone ethics courses; it believes that people need to look at the culture of institutions and the culture of labs, and integrate ethics into the research being done. We've been gratified that the center's approach has been recognized as one of the best practices in ethics education.\"Laas and Hildt, along with Illinois Tech Clinical Associate Professor of Innovation Christine Miller and Eric Brey,professor and chair of biomedical engineering, are collaborating on an NSF-funded project to further refine ethics education within the university and, over time, to initiate a change in ethical behavior within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments and laboratories at Illinois Tech and beyond. The team'sproject aims to develop guidelines for identifying ethical problems and navigating the decision-making process within a STEM department or lab. Select doctoral students in biology, physics, biomedical engineering, and electrochemical engineering are conducting interviews with undergraduates, peers, and staff to determine areas of ethical concern and to develop laboratory-specific ethical guidelines.\"It's often not that easy to teach ethics in an efficient way, so we began thinking of new approaches such as teaching out of the classroom and directly within the context of the research lab, where people are confronted by ethics issues,\" explains Hildt, adding that the ethics center team spent the summer conducting information-gathering surveys. \"The students will use ethics codes from their fields, many collected by the center, as potential resources. In most cases, there's not much information regarding labs. Once guideline drafts are completed, the students will share them with faculty, staff, and colleagues within their respective departments.\"Brey says the hope is that by leading much of the project, the students will learn to develop and nurture a mindset, rather than just try to manage situations of inappropriate behavior after the fact.\"Ethical issues can include how faculty should interact with students and mentor them and how researchers can make decisions about understanding their data and promoting their data in a way that is responsible, that can best inform people, and that doesn't direct people in the wrong way,\" says Brey. \"How confident do we need to be? No one person can know everything.\"Illinois Tech students also have two extracurricular opportunities to explore ethics topics. The ethics club,, meets weekly over lunch during the academic year to debate ethics issues in the news. The annual, held annually since its inception at Illinois Tech in 1993, is a nationwide competition that features two teams of three to five undergraduates who answer questions on a wide variety of ethics issues and debate their responses with the opposing team. A panel of judges determines the winning team using detailed evaluation criteria.Reno Fera-Ducatt Waswil (PHYS '17), who teaches high school students SAT test-taking strategies for, was a member of the regional 2016\u201317 Ethics Bowl team and former QED president. He reflects on how his experiences served to make him a more effective decision-maker today.\"There are three main areas I can point to in which involvement in QED and the Ethics Bowl has helped me\u2014in recognizing the patterns of complex ethical issues; in making concrete conclusions based on the population of information and evidence available; and in justifying these considerate analyses and conclusions publicly and being able to respond to an array of critique on them,\" he says, adding that his ethics experiences have helped him to make a wide range of lifestyle improvements from refining his job interviewing techniques to relating better to his audience when making presentations to even developing empathetic characters as an aspiring creative writer.Attorney Gretchen A. Winter, executive director of theat the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Business, says that while the Ethics Bowl has given many students the chance to discuss ethical issues in a variety of contexts, it is only one facet of a center that she made her first stop when seeking ethics resources and guidance on ethics center design and management after being named to her current position.\"The center's leadership in defining and sharing ways to apply\u00a0professional ethics standards in a wide range of circumstances has been a valuable source of guidance to\u00a0faculty, students, and practitioners,\" she says. \"The Ethics Center has been at the cutting edge of professional ethics since Vivian Weil took the helm many years ago. Under Elisabeth's direction the leadership and guidance continues\u2014and the community of academically based\u00a0ethics centers continues to grow.\""}, {"page": "https://magazine.iit.edu/fall-2017/passings", "content": "EE '40Hot Spring Village, Ark.ME '43Lac Du Flambeau, Wis.ME '44Sedalia, Mo.ME '45Burien, Wash.CHE '45Riverside, Calif.FPE '45Wilmette, Ill.EE '48Orange, Calif.EE '48West Hartford, Conn.ME '49, M.S.
